## The High Stakes of Launch Day

You've spent months building your server—custom plugins, detailed spawn, balanced economy, curated world. Launch day approaches. Are you ready?

A failed launch is devastating:
- **Player churn**: Poor first impression = lost players forever
- **Reputation damage**: "Laggy server" label sticks
- **Staff burnout**: Firefighting issues instead of welcoming players
- **Wasted marketing**: Promotion efforts wasted on broken experience

A successful launch builds momentum:
- **Strong first impressions**: Smooth gameplay = returning players
- **Positive word-of-mouth**: Players invite friends
- **Staff confidence**: Team executes well-rehearsed plan
- **Growth foundation**: Solid base for future expansion

This guide ensures you're ready.

## Pre-Launch Validation Checklist

<Steps>

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (2-4 Weeks Before Launch)

#### Hardware Verification

**Test 1: Resource Capacity**

```bash title="Server Resource Monitoring"
# Monitor idle server resources
htop

# Check disk space
df -h

# Test disk I/O speed
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test bs=1G count=1 oflag=direct
# Should achieve >200 MB/s for SSD

# Network bandwidth test
iperf3 -c speedtest.server.com
```

**Minimum recommendations:**

| Server Size | RAM | CPU | Disk | Network |
|-------------|-----|-----|------|---------|
| Small (10-20 players) | 4GB | 2 cores | 20GB SSD | 100 Mbps |
| Medium (50-100) | 8GB | 4 cores | 50GB SSD | 500 Mbps |
| Large (200+) | 16GB+ | 8+ cores | 100GB+ SSD | 1 Gbps |

**Red flags:**
- RAM &lt;2GB per 10 players
- HDD instead of SSD (5-10x slower)
- CPU from before 2018
- Shared hosting with unknown neighbors

#### Backup System

**Test 2: Backup and Restore**

```bash title="Backup Testing"
# Create full backup
./backup-server.sh

# Verify backup file created
ls -lh backups/

# Test restore to separate directory
mkdir test-restore
tar -xzf backups/latest.tar.gz -C test-restore

# Start restored server
cd test-restore
java -jar paper.jar --nogui

# Verify world loads correctly
```

**Automation:**

```bash title="Cron Backup Automation"
# Schedule automatic backups
crontab -e

# Add:
0 */6 * * * /path/to/backup-server.sh  # Every 6 hours
0 4 * * * /path/to/backup-server.sh && /path/to/upload-to-s3.sh  # Daily offsite
```

**Critical:**
- Test restore BEFORE launch
- Automated backups configured
- Offsite backup storage
- Backup retention policy (7 days minimum)

#### Security Hardening

**Test 3: Security Audit**

```bash title="Security Verification"
# Check firewall rules
sudo iptables -L -n

# Verify only necessary ports open
sudo nmap -p- localhost

# Test DDoS protection
# (Use testing tool or service)

# Verify SSH key authentication
grep "PasswordAuthentication no" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Security checklist:**
- [ ] Firewall configured (only ports 25565, 22, 80/443 if needed)
- [ ] SSH key authentication (no password login)
- [ ] Fail2ban or similar brute-force protection
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] Backup server IP hidden (behind proxy/firewall)

### Phase 2: Server Configuration (1-2 Weeks Before Launch)

#### Performance Optimization

<Callout type="info" title="Performance Recommendations">
- **Use [Paper](https://papermc.io/)** for superior performance over Spigot/Bukkit
- **Install [Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/)** for profiling and performance monitoring
- **Use [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky)** for world pregeneration
- **Allocate appropriate RAM** - 4GB minimum for small servers, 8GB+ for medium
- **Use Aikar's JVM flags** for optimized garbage collection
</Callout>

**Test 4: Baseline Performance**

```bash title="Spark Performance Baseline"
# Start empty server
# Connect and run (requires Spark plugin: https://spark.lucko.me/)
/spark tps
/spark heapsummary

# Record baseline:
# TPS: 20.0
# MSPT: < 10ms
# RAM: <25% of max
# CPU: <20%
```

**Configuration review:**

```properties title="server.properties"
# server.properties
view-distance=8
simulation-distance=4
spawn-protection=16
max-players=100
online-mode=true
```

```yaml title="paper-world-defaults.yml"
# paper-world-defaults.yml
spawn-limits:
  monster: 20
  creature: 5
  water_creature: 2

entities:
  behavior:
    max-entity-collisions: 2

chunks:
  auto-save-interval: 300  # 5 minutes
```

**Critical checks:**
- [ ] View/simulation distance optimized
- [ ] Spawn limits configured
- [ ] Auto-save interval reasonable
- [ ] Garbage collection optimized (Aikar's flags)

#### World Preparation

**Test 5: Spawn Area Optimization**

```bash title="Chunky Pregeneration"
# Pregenerate spawn chunks (requires Chunky plugin: https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky)
/chunky center 0 0
/chunky radius 5000
/chunky start

# Monitor progress
/chunky status

# Wait for completion (can take hours)
```

**Why pregeneration matters:**

| Without Pregeneration | With Pregeneration |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Launch day: 100 players explore | Launch day: Chunks already generated |
| Server generates chunks on-demand | No generation lag |
| TPS drops to 5-10 | TPS stays 18-20 |
| Block break delay 3+ seconds | Instant response |
| Players complain of lag | Smooth experience |

**Spawn area checklist:**
- [ ] 5,000-10,000 block radius pregenerated
- [ ] Spawn point set correctly (`/setworldspawn`)
- [ ] Spawn area built and decorated
- [ ] Important buildings accessible
- [ ] Signs/holograms with basic info
- [ ] No hazards (lava, cliffs, mobs)

#### Economy and Progression

**Test 6: Economy Balance**

```text title="Economy Progression Testing"
Test progression path:
1. New player joins
2. Complete starter tasks
3. Earn first currency
4. Purchase first item
5. Progress to next tier

Time to reach milestones:
- First purchase: <15 minutes
- Iron tools: <30 minutes
- Diamond tools: 2-3 hours
- Endgame items: 20-40 hours

Monitor:
- Starting money reasonable?
- Prices balanced?
- Earning rate appropriate?
- No exploits?
```

**Red flags:**
- Players get rich too quickly (inflation, boredom)
- Players can't afford anything (frustration)
- One method vastly outperforms others (exploitation)
- Endgame reachable in &lt;10 hours (no longevity)

### Phase 3: Plugin Validation (1 Week Before Launch)

#### Plugin Compatibility

**Test 7: Plugin Conflicts**

```bash title="Plugin Conflict Detection"
# List all plugins
ls plugins/*.jar

# Start server and monitor for errors
tail -f logs/latest.log | grep -i error

# Common conflicts:
# - Multiple economy plugins
# - Duplicate feature plugins (two claim plugins)
# - Incompatible versions
```

**Test each major plugin:**

```text title="Plugin Testing Checklist"
For each plugin:
1. Verify it loads without errors
2. Test primary feature
3. Test interaction with other plugins
4. Check permissions work correctly

Example (Claim plugin):
1. /claim (create claim)
2. Invite another player
3. Test permissions (can build, can't build)
4. Remove claim
5. Verify persistence across restart
```

**Critical plugins to validate:**
- [ ] Economy (Vault + provider)
- [ ] Permissions (LuckPerms)
- [ ] Claims/Protection
- [ ] Chat formatting
- [ ] Teleportation/homes
- [ ] Anti-cheat

#### Command and Permission Testing

**Test 8: Permission Hierarchy**

```yaml title="Permission Group Testing"
# Test user progression
Groups to test:
- default (new player)
- member (played 1+ hour)
- vip (donor)
- moderator
- admin

For each group:
- Test can use expected commands
- Test cannot use restricted commands
- Verify chat prefix/suffix correct
- Check tab list formatting
```

**Permission checklist:**
- [ ] Default group has basic commands only
- [ ] Staff have moderation commands
- [ ] Admin has full access
- [ ] VIP perks work correctly
- [ ] No permission leaks (default can't ban, etc.)

### Phase 4: Player Experience (3-5 Days Before Launch)

#### New Player Flow

**Test 9: First-Time User Experience (FTUE)**

```text title="New Player Journey Test"
Roleplay as new player:
1. Join server for first time
2. Read welcome message
3. Follow instructions
4. Complete starter quests/tasks
5. Obtain first tools/items
6. Find important locations

Time this process - should take 10-20 minutes

Validate:
- Instructions clear?
- Tasks completable?
- Rewards satisfying?
- Direction obvious?
- No confusion?
```

**FTUE checklist:**
- [ ] Wel come message informative but concise
- [ ] Spawn point visible from all angles
- [ ] Signs guide to important areas
- [ ] Starter quests exist and work
- [ ] /help command provides useful info
- [ ] Rules are posted and accessible

Test tab list:
- Groups colored/formatted?
- Server info in footer?
- Ping showing correctly?

Test scoreboard (if used):
- Information relevant?
- Updates correctly?
- No flickering?
```

**First impressions matter:**

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| Polished spawn build | Unfinished builds, scaffolding |
| Clear signage | Confusing layout |
| Helpful starter NPC | No guidance |
| Welcoming message | No welcome message or wall of text |
| Working features | Broken commands, "Coming soon" |

### Phase 5: Load Testing (2-3 Days Before Launch)

#### Stress Testing

**Test 11: Simulated Player Load**

```text title="Load Test Progression"
Test progression:
- 10 players: 5 minutes
- 25 players: 10 minutes
- 50 players: 15 minutes
- 75 players: 15 minutes
- 100 players: 20 minutes

Monitor throughout (using Spark: https://spark.lucko.me/):
/spark tps
/spark profiler (capture 120-second profile)
/spark heapsummary

Expected results:
- TPS >18 throughout
- MSPT <50 throughout
- RAM <75% of max
- CPU <80%
```

**Load test scenarios:**

```text title="Load Test Scenarios"
Scenario 1: Mass Join (Launch Day Simulation)

- Checks garbage collection frequency
```

#### Network Performance

**Test 12: Connection Quality**

```bash title="Network Latency Testing"
# Test from various locations
# Use VPS in different regions

# From US East
ping your-server.com
traceroute your-server.com

# From EU
ping your-server.com
traceroute your-server.com

# Record latency:
# US East: 20ms ✅
# US West: 60ms ✅

</Steps>

## Launch Day Protocol

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical Launch Reminders">
- **One crash during launch = many lost players forever**
- **Stability is more important than features** - disable anything unstable
- **Have a rollback plan** - be ready to revert if critical issues arise
- **Communicate delays immediately** - players appreciate transparency
- **All staff must be online and ready** - no exceptions for launch
</Callout>

### T-Minus 1 Hour

```text title="Final Pre-Launch Protocol"
1. Final restart
   - /stop
   - Clear cache/temporary files
   - Start with fresh logs

2. Staff assembly
   - All staff online
   - Roles assigned
   - Communication channels open

3. Final systems check
   - /spark tps (should be 20.0)
   - /plugins (all green)
   - Test connection from external

4. Open whitelist (if used)
   - /whitelist off
   or
   - Add initial players to whitelist

5. Send announcement
   - Discord
   - Social media
   - Server lists (if posted early)
```

### T-Minus 0: Launch!

```text title="Launch Monitoring Checklist"
Monitor closely:
- Player count
- TPS (should stay >18)
- Chat (answer questions)

Have ready:
- Backup plan if issues arise
- Communication to delay if critical issue
- Staff on standby

Engage with players:
- Welcome personally
- Answer questions
- Thank for joining
- Guide to features
```

### First Hour Priorities

1. **Stability above all**: One crash = many lost players
2. **Responsive support**: Answer questions quickly
3. **Fix blockers immediately**: Can't claim? Fix NOW
4. **Defer polish**: Typo in sign? Fix tomorrow
5. **Monitor metrics**: Watch TPS, player count, errors

## Post-Launch Validation

### First 24 Hours

**Metrics to track:**

```text title="Launch Metrics Tracking"
Players:
- Peak concurrent players
- Total unique joins
- Average session length
- Return rate (players who come back)

Performance:
- Minimum TPS during peak
- Crashes or restarts
- Plugin errors
- Player complaints

Engagement:
- Chat activity
- Feature usage (claims, shops, etc.)
- Quest/achievement completion
- Discord activity
```

### First Week

**Review and iterate:**

```text title="Post-Launch Review Template"
What went well:
- Stable TPS throughout
- No major bugs
- Players engaged with custom features
- Staff handled volume well

What needs improvement:
- Economy balancing (items too cheap)
- Spawn can be confusing for new players
- One plugin has minor bug
- Need more staff during peak hours

Action items:
1. Adjust shop prices
2. Add more spawn signs
3. Update buggy plugin
4. Recruit 2 more moderators
```

## Using Bots for Pre-Launch Testing

Manual testing has limits. Bots enable comprehensive, realistic validation.

### Why Bots for Pre-Launch?

**Manual testing gaps:**
- Can't simulate 100 players joining simultaneously
- Hard to test for extended periods (4+ hours)
- Can't create consistent load scenarios
- Difficult to test edge cases

**Bot testing advantages:**
- Simulate launch day surge (50-100 players joining rapidly)
- Endurance testing (bots online for 24 hours)
- Consistent scenarios (same test every time)
- Performance benchmarking (measure exactly how many players server handles)

### Pre-Launch Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Launch Day Simulation**

```text title="Launch Day Test Configuration"
Objective: Simulate opening day player surge

Configuration:
- 100 bots
- Join over 10 minutes (10 bots/minute)
- Stagger logins naturally

Test:
1. Bots start joining at T+0
2. By T+10min, 100 bots connected
3. Bots remain online for 1 hour
4. Monitor server stability

Metrics:
- Connection success rate (target: >95%)
- TPS during surge (target: >18)
- TPS after stabilization (target: 19-20)
- Memory usage (target: <75% max)
- Any errors or crashes (target: 0)

Expected:
✅ 95+ bots connect successfully
✅ TPS remains 18+ throughout
✅ No errors in console
✅ Spawn area loads for all bots
```

**Scenario 2: Exploration Stress Test**

```text title="Exploration Test Configuration"
Objective: Test chunk loading during exploration

Configuration:
- 30 bots
- Anti-AFK plugin (random movement)
- Duration: 2 hours

Test:
1. Bots connect to spawn
2. Enable movement (walk in random directions)
3. Bots explore outward from spawn
4. Monitor chunk generation and TPS

Metrics:
- TPS during high I/O
- Chunk generation rate
- Disk I/O saturation
- RAM usage (world data)

Expected:
✅ TPS >18 during movement
✅ Chunks generate without errors
✅ RAM increases proportionally (not leak)
✅ Disk I/O within limits
```

**Scenario 3: Economy System Test**

```text title="Economy Test Configuration"
Objective: Verify economy handles transactions

Configuration:
- 20 bots
- Bots execute economy commands

Test:
1. Bots receive starting balance
2. Bots purchase items from shop
3. Bots sell items back
4. Check for economy exploits or dupes

Validation:
- Balance changes correctly
- Transactions log properly
- No money creation (duplication)
- Shop inventory updates
```

**Scenario 4: Claim System Test**

```text title="Claim System Test Configuration"
Objective: Validate land claiming under load

Configuration:
- 25 bots

Test:
1. Bots teleport to claiming area
2. All 25 bots create claims simultaneously
3. Verify claims don't overlap
4. Check database for corruption

Expected:
✅ All claims created successfully
✅ No overlapping claims
✅ Database intact
✅ Server remains stable
```

**Scenario 5: Endurance and Memory Leak Test**

```text title="Endurance Test Configuration"
Objective: Long-term stability check

Configuration:
- 40 bots
- Duration: 12-24 hours

Test:
1. Bots connect and remain online
2. Bots perform basic actions periodically
3. Monitor memory usage over time

Monitor:
- Memory usage trend (should be stable or slight increase)
- GC frequency (should remain consistent)
- TPS degradation (should stay 19-20)
- Connection stability (bots shouldn't disconnect)

Red flags:
❌ Memory usage increasing steadily (memory leak)
❌ TPS degrading over time
❌ Frequent disconnections
❌ Increasing GC pauses

Expected:
✅ Memory stabilizes after initial period
✅ TPS consistent throughout
✅ All bots remain connected
✅ No errors accumulating
```

### Interpreting Bot Test Results

**Good Launch Readiness:**

```text title="Successful Test Results"
Test Results:
- 100/100 bots connected successfully (100%)
- TPS during peak: 18.2 minimum, 19.5 average
- Peak memory: 68% of max
- Peak CPU: 75%
- Errors: 0
- Crashes: 0
- Endurance test: 24 hours stable

Interpretation:
✅ Server ready for launch
✅ Can handle advertised capacity
✅ No critical issues detected
✅ Performance acceptable under load
```

**Needs Improvement:**

```text title="Failed Test Results"
Test Results:
- 85/100 bots connected (85% success)
- TPS during peak: 12.5 minimum (❌)
- Peak memory: 92% of max (⚠️)
- Peak CPU: 95% (❌)
- Errors: 15 plugin exceptions
- Crashes: 1 during stress test

Interpretation:
❌ NOT ready for launch
❌ Connection issues (investigate server capacity)
❌ TPS unacceptable (optimize or upgrade)
❌ Memory/CPU near max (no headroom for spikes)
❌ Plugin errors need resolution

Action:
1. Optimize server configuration
2. Fix plugin errors
3. Upgrade hardware if needed
4. Retest before launch
```

### Using SoulFire for Pre-Launch Validation

Comprehensive pre-launch testing requires realistic client behavior and protocol compliance. SoulFire's Fabric-based architecture makes it ideal for final validation.

**Launch Day Simulation:**

```text title="SoulFire Launch Simulation"
Configuration:
- Bots: 100
- Join Pattern: 10 per minute for 10 minutes
- Plugins: Auto-Respawn, Anti-AFK, Auto-Reconnect

Simulate realistic launch:
1. Staggered bot logins (mimics real players)
2. Bots spread across spawn (movement)
3. Monitor TPS, chunk loading, errors
4. Run for 2 hours

Goal:
Validate server handles launch day surge with:
- No crashes
- Acceptable TPS (>18)
- All players can connect
- No game-breaking bugs discovered
```

**What to Monitor:**

```bash title="Launch Monitoring Commands"
# Server console
tail -f logs/latest.log | grep -E "(ERROR|WARN|Exception)"

# Performance
/spark tps  # Check every 30 seconds

# Player list
/list  # Verify bot count increasing

# Resource usage
htop  # Monitor CPU/RAM in separate terminal
```

**Success Criteria:**

```text title="Launch Readiness Criteria"
✅ 95+ bots connected
✅ TPS >18 during surge, >19 after stabilization
✅ No errors or exceptions
✅ Spawn area handles 100 players simultaneously
✅ Movement smooth, no rubber-banding
✅ Commands responsive
✅ No crashes for 2+ hour duration

= SERVER READY FOR LAUNCH
```

## Conclusion

A successful launch isn't luck—it's preparation. By systematically validating every aspect of your server, from infrastructure to player experience, you ensure launch day exceeds expectations rather than becoming a disaster recovery exercise.

Key takeaways:

1. **Test early and often**: Don't wait until launch eve to discover critical issues
2. **Optimize spawn area**: Pregenerate chunks, polish builds, clear guidance
3. **Load test thoroughly**: Bots simulate realistic player behavior and stress
4. **Prepare staff**: Training and documentation prevent chaos
5. **Have backups**: Things will go wrong—be ready to recover

The servers that succeed long-term are those that launch strong. First impressions matter. Put in the work to validate everything beforehand, and your launch day will be smooth, your players will be happy, and your server will thrive.

**Remember: Launch day is not the time to discover your server can't handle 50 players. Test with 100 before you advertise for 50.**

Your players are counting on you. Make sure you're ready for them.

Good luck with your launch! 🚀
