## The High Stakes of Launch Day

You've spent months building your server — custom plugins, detailed spawn, balanced economy, curated world. A failed launch undoes all of that. Players who hit lag or broken features on day one don't come back, and the "laggy server" label is nearly impossible to shake. This guide walks through a structured validation process so launch day goes smoothly.

## Pre-Launch Validation

<Steps>

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (2-4 Weeks Out)

Start with the foundation. No amount of plugin tuning saves you from bad hardware or missing backups.

**Hardware requirements by server size:**

| Server Size | RAM | CPU | Disk | Network |
|-------------|-----|-----|------|---------|
| Small (10-20 players) | 4GB | 2 cores | 20GB SSD | 100 Mbps |
| Medium (50-100) | 8GB | 4 cores | 50GB SSD | 500 Mbps |
| Large (200+) | 16GB+ | 8+ cores | 100GB+ SSD | 1 Gbps |

Run baseline checks on your hardware before anything else:

```bash
# Disk I/O speed — target >200 MB/s for SSD
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test bs=1G count=1 oflag=direct

# Network bandwidth
iperf3 -c speedtest.server.com

# Disk space — keep >50% free for headroom
df -h
```

Red flags: HDD instead of SSD, less than 2GB RAM per 10 expected players, shared hosting with unknown neighbors.

**Backups:** Test your restore process *before* launch, not after your first crash. Create a full backup, extract it to a separate directory, and verify the world loads. Schedule automated backups via cron — every 6 hours locally, daily offsite.

**Security:** Lock down your firewall to only the ports you need (25565, 22, 80/443 if applicable). Disable SSH password authentication. Install Fail2ban. Keep the backend IP hidden behind a proxy if possible.

### Phase 2: Server Configuration (1-2 Weeks Out)

<Callout type="info" title="Detailed Optimization Guide">
For a thorough walkthrough of view/simulation distance tuning, entity limit configuration, chunk pregeneration, JVM flags, and profiling with Spark, see our [Stress Testing Minecraft Servers](/blog/stress-testing-minecraft-servers) guide. The sections below cover what to verify, not how to tune from scratch.
</Callout>

**Establish a performance baseline** on an empty server using [Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/). You want TPS at 20.0, MSPT under 10ms, RAM under 25% of max, and CPU under 20%. These numbers give you a reference point for everything that follows.

**Configuration checklist:**

- **View and simulation distance** — Lower simulation distance reduces entity processing overhead without sacrificing player visibility. See the [stress testing guide](/blog/stress-testing-minecraft-servers#view-and-simulation-distance) for recommended values by server size.
- **Entity limits** — Tighten Paper's mob spawn caps and collision limits. Default values are far too generous for servers expecting 50+ players.
- **World pregeneration** — Non-negotiable. Without it, 100 players exploring on launch day forces on-demand chunk generation and TPS drops to single digits. Use [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) to pregenerate at least a 5,000-block radius from spawn. This can take hours — plan accordingly.
- **JVM flags** — Use [Aikar's flags](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags) for optimized garbage collection. Match Xms and Xmx to your available RAM.
- **Server software** — [Paper](https://papermc.io/) is the baseline. For 100+ player targets, consider [Pufferfish](https://pufferfish.host/).

Verify each setting, restart, and confirm your baseline metrics haven't regressed before moving on.

### Phase 3: Plugin Validation (1 Week Out)

Start the server and watch the logs for errors:

```bash
tail -f logs/latest.log | grep -i error
```

Common sources of trouble: multiple economy plugins conflicting, duplicate feature plugins (two claim systems), and version mismatches. For each critical plugin — economy, permissions, claims, chat, teleportation, anti-cheat — verify it loads cleanly, test its primary features, test its interactions with other plugins, and check that permissions are correctly assigned.

**Permission hierarchy:** Walk through each rank (default, member, VIP, moderator, admin) and verify that players can use exactly the commands they should and nothing more. Check chat prefixes, tab list formatting, and that there are no permission leaks giving default players access to moderation commands.

### Phase 4: Player Experience (3-5 Days Out)

**First-time user experience.** Join your own server as if you've never seen it before. Read the welcome message. Follow the instructions. Complete the starter tasks. This process should take 10-20 minutes and leave a new player with basic tools, a sense of direction, and an understanding of what your server offers.

Things to check at spawn: lighting has no dark patches, builds are complete (no scaffolding left), signs are readable and guide players to important areas, there are no hazards near the spawn point, and the `/help` command provides useful information. Rules should be posted and accessible.

**Economy balance:** Walk through the progression path. A new player should be able to make their first purchase within 15 minutes and reach iron tools within 30 minutes. Diamond tools should take 2-3 hours, endgame items 20-40 hours. Watch out for players getting rich too quickly (causes inflation and boredom) or one earning method vastly outperforming all others (causes exploitation).

### Phase 5: Load Testing (2-3 Days Out)

This is where bot testing becomes essential. Manual testing can't simulate 100 players joining simultaneously, maintain consistent load for hours, or create repeatable stress scenarios. Our [stress testing guide](/blog/stress-testing-minecraft-servers) covers the full methodology — incremental load ramps, realistic bot behavior, spike testing, and endurance runs. Follow that process here, but focus on these launch-specific scenarios:

- **Mass join:** Simulate 50-100 players connecting within a few minutes — the launch surge. Watch for connection failures, spawn area performance, and TPS dips during the initial flood.
- **Spawn pressure:** Your spawn area will bear the heaviest load on day one. Verify it handles your full target player count without rubber-banding or block interaction delays.
- **Endurance:** Run at 50-75% of target capacity for 4-12 hours. Watch for memory leaks, TPS degradation over time, increasing GC pauses, and accumulating errors in the log.

**Network latency:** Test connectivity from your target regions. Under 100ms is good, 100-200ms is acceptable, above 250ms will noticeably affect gameplay.

### Phase 6: Staff and Communications (1-2 Days Out)

Train your staff on common issues and moderation commands before launch, not during it. Document solutions to predictable problems: "can't claim land" (check balance), "can't use command" (check rank), "grief reported" (use `/co inspect`, rollback if needed). Set up an on-call schedule so you have coverage during peak hours.

Verify Discord channels are configured, staff bots respond to commands, and your announcement is drafted and ready to send.

### Phase 7: Final Validation (Day Before Launch)

Do a complete walkthrough of the player journey — join, orientation, resource gathering, claiming, building, social features, economy. Every feature should work without errors.

Run final system health checks:

```bash
# Verify services
ps aux | grep java
ps aux | grep mysql

# Disk space
df -h

# DNS resolution
nslookup your-server.com

# Recent backup exists
ls -lh backups/

# No errors in logs
tail -100 logs/latest.log
```

</Steps>

## Launch Day Protocol

<Callout type="warning" title="Launch Day Priorities">
- **Stability over features** — disable anything that isn't rock-solid
- **Have a rollback plan** — be ready to revert if critical issues emerge
- **Communicate delays immediately** — players appreciate honesty
- **All staff online** — no exceptions during the launch window
</Callout>

**One hour before launch:** Restart the server fresh. Clear temporary files. Verify TPS is at 20.0, all plugins loaded green, and external connections work. Assemble staff and open communications.

**At launch:** Remove the whitelist (or start adding players), send your announcement, and monitor closely. Watch player count, TPS, chat, and the console for errors. Staff should be actively welcoming players and answering questions.

**First hour priorities:** Fix anything that blocks core gameplay immediately (broken claims, connection issues, economy bugs). Defer cosmetic issues like typos on signs to the next day. One crash during the first hour costs you more players than any other time.

## Post-Launch

**First 24 hours:** Track peak concurrent players, total unique joins, average session length, minimum TPS during peak, crashes, and plugin errors.

**First week:** Review what went well and what didn't. Adjust economy balancing, improve spawn signage, fix minor bugs, recruit additional staff if needed. The servers that succeed long-term are the ones that iterate quickly after launch.

## Using SoulFire for Load Testing

Manual testing can validate features, but it can't answer the question that matters most: will your server survive 100 players joining at once? SoulFire's Fabric-based architecture produces realistic client behavior and full protocol compliance, making it ideal for pre-launch stress testing.

Configure a launch simulation: 100 bots joining over 10 minutes (10 per minute), with Auto-Respawn, Anti-AFK, and Auto-Reconnect enabled. Let it run for 2 hours while monitoring with Spark and watching the console for errors.

```bash
# Monitor during the test
tail -f logs/latest.log | grep -E "(ERROR|WARN|Exception)"
```

**Your server is ready when:**
- 95+ bots connect successfully
- TPS stays above 18 during the surge and above 19 after stabilization
- No errors, exceptions, or crashes
- Spawn area handles the full player count without rubber-banding
- Commands remain responsive throughout

If you hit less than 85% connection success, TPS drops below 15, or memory usage exceeds 90%, you need to optimize your configuration, fix plugin errors, or upgrade hardware before going live.

## Conclusion

A successful launch is preparation, not luck. Test infrastructure early, validate every plugin, optimize your spawn area, and run realistic load tests with bots. The time you invest in pre-launch validation pays off in player retention, server reputation, and your own sanity on opening day. Launch day is not the time to discover your server can't handle 50 players — test with 100 before you advertise for 50.
