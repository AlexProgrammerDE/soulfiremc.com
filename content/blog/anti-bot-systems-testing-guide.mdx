## Defending Your Minecraft Server Against Bots

Bot attacks on Minecraft servers range from crude connection floods to sophisticated proxy-rotated campaigns that can drain bandwidth, crash your server, and drive away legitimate players. This guide covers how to build layered defenses and, critically, how to test that they actually work.

<Callout type="danger">
**This guide is for server administrators testing their own infrastructure.** Never perform bot attacks or load testing on servers you don't own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized attacks are illegal and unethical.
</Callout>

### Common Attack Types

- **Connection flooding**: Hundreds or thousands of simultaneous connection attempts overwhelm the server's handler before authentication even begins.
- **Join/leave spam**: Bots join, immediately disconnect, and reconnect, consuming resources during authentication and world loading.
- **Proxy-rotated attacks**: Traffic routed through thousands of proxies makes IP-based blocking ineffective.
- **Protocol-level attacks**: Malformed or excessive packets exploit server vulnerabilities or burn CPU cycles.

### Defense in Layers

No single solution stops every attack. Effective protection uses multiple layers so that attackers who bypass one hit another.

| Layer | Where | Tools | Catches |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Network/Firewall | Before Minecraft | iptables, nftables, UFW | Raw connection floods, IP-based attacks |
| Proxy | BungeeCord/Velocity | Proxy anti-bot plugins | Distributed attacks, early filtering |
| Server | Paper/Spigot | EpicGuard, UltimateAntiBot | Behavioral analysis, verification |
| Game | Plugin-level | AuthMe, custom systems | In-game bot behavior, AFK farming |

## Network-Level Protection

The first line of defense blocks attacks before they reach your Minecraft server.

<Tabs items={['iptables', 'nftables', 'UFW']}>
  <Tab value="iptables">
### iptables

Rate-limit new connections and use [ipset](https://ipset.netfilter.org/) for scalable blacklisting. See the [iptables documentation](https://netfilter.org/documentation/) for more details.

```bash
# Allow established connections
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Rate limit new connections to port 25565 (3 per minute per IP)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -m state --state NEW \
  -m recent --set
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -m state --state NEW \
  -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -j ACCEPT

# SYN flood protection
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -m limit --limit 1/s --limit-burst 3 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -j DROP
```

For managing large blacklists efficiently, use ipset:

```bash
sudo ipset create minecraft-blacklist hash:ip hashsize 4096 maxelem 100000
sudo ipset add minecraft-blacklist 1.2.3.4
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 \
  -m set --match-set minecraft-blacklist src -j DROP
```

```bash
# Make rules persistent (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="nftables">
### nftables

The modern replacement for iptables with cleaner syntax and better performance.

```bash
sudo nft add table inet filter
sudo nft add chain inet filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; }

# Allow established connections
sudo nft add rule inet filter input ct state established,related accept

# Rate limit new connections to port 25565
sudo nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport 25565 ct state new \
  limit rate 3/minute accept

# Drop the rest
sudo nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport 25565 drop
```

```bash
# Save ruleset (loads automatically on boot with nftables service enabled)
sudo nft list ruleset > /etc/nftables.conf
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="UFW">
### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

A simpler frontend for iptables, good for basic setups.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp
sudo ufw limit 25565/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

<Callout>
UFW's rate limiting is less flexible than iptables/nftables. For advanced protection, use one of the other options.

## Server-Level Anti-Bot Plugins

Network filtering blocks crude attacks, but sophisticated bots need behavioral analysis at the server level.

### EpicGuard

[EpicGuard](https://github.com/4drian3d/EpicGuard) is a popular open-source anti-bot plugin (discontinued as of 2025, but still widely used and forked). Consult the [official documentation](https://github.com/4drian3d/EpicGuard) for the latest configuration options.

```yaml title="plugins/EpicGuard/config.yml"
check-mode:
  # ALWAYS / ATTACK / NEVER
  server-list-check: ATTACK    # Require ping before join
  reconnect-check: ALWAYS      # Force re-authentication
  settings-check: ATTACK       # Validate client settings packet
  proxy-check: ATTACK          # Check for VPN/proxy usage
  nickname-check: ATTACK       # Validate nickname patterns

auto-whitelist:
  enabled: true
  time: 300  # Seconds online before auto-whitelisting

attack:
  connection-threshold: 8      # Connections/sec to trigger attack mode
  decay-time: 120              # Seconds to stay in attack mode
  deny-join: false             # Block all new joins during attacks
```

| Setting | Recommended | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `server-list-check` | ATTACK | Bots often skip the server list ping |
| `reconnect-check` | ALWAYS | Stops simple join spam |
| `connection-threshold` | 5-10 | Lower = more sensitive, higher risk of false positives |
| `auto-whitelist` | true | Reduces overhead for known players |

### UltimateAntiBot

A more modern alternative with iptables integration. Detected bot IPs get added directly to your firewall, blocking them at the kernel level.

```yaml title="config.yml"
settings:
  use-iptables: true
  blacklist-command: "ipset add minecraft-blacklist %ip%"
  unblacklist-command: "ipset del minecraft-blacklist %ip%"

checks:
  connect-speed:
    enabled: true
    max-per-second: 4
  ping-check:
    enabled: true
    required-before-join: true

verification:
  enabled: true
  method: CHAT
  chat-verification:
    code-length: 6
    timeout-seconds: 60
```

## DDoS Protection Services

For servers facing professional attackers, dedicated services absorb traffic before it reaches you.

- **[TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/)**: Minecraft-specific proxy network. Players connect to TCPShield, which filters malicious traffic and forwards clean connections. Free tier available, adds 5-20ms latency.
- **[Cloudflare Spectrum](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/)**: Enterprise-grade Layer 3/4 protection. Handles 100+ Gbps attacks but requires a Business/Enterprise plan.

## Testing Your Defenses

Configuration without validation is guesswork. You need to verify that your anti-bot setup actually blocks attacks while letting legitimate players through.

### Setting Up a Test Environment

Never test against production. Clone your setup to an isolated server:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/prod-server /path/to/test-server

# Change port in server.properties to avoid conflicts
# server-port=25566

cd /path/to/test-server
java -Xms2G -Xmx2G -jar paper.jar nogui
```

### What to Test

**Baseline (legitimate traffic)**: Join with a real client. Have multiple real players join within 30 seconds. Disconnect and reconnect rapidly. All of these should work without delays or false positives.

**Simulated attacks**: Start small (10 bots over 60 seconds) and escalate (50 bots in 10 seconds, sustained reconnect spam over 5 minutes). Monitor which checks trigger, how quickly attack mode activates, and whether TPS degrades.

**False positives**: Test scenarios that mimic legitimate but suspicious behavior. Multiple players behind the same router, players on VPNs, and players with unstable connections that cause rapid reconnects. If any get blocked, adjust thresholds or whitelist them.

### Using SoulFire for Testing

SoulFire's Fabric-based architecture makes it particularly effective for anti-bot testing because it uses actual Minecraft client code. Your anti-bot system can't detect bots simply by checking for protocol quirks, which means tests reflect real-world attack patterns.

Useful SoulFire plugins for testing:

- **server-list-bypass**: Tests whether your server-list check actually blocks bots that skip the ping step
- **anti-afk**: Generates random movement to test behavioral analysis
- **auto-chat-message**: Tests chat-based verification systems
- **client-settings**: Sends proper client configuration packets

### Interpreting Results

After running tests, check your plugin's statistics:

| Block Rate | Assessment | Action |
|------------|------------|--------|
| <50% | Ineffective | Enable more checks, lower thresholds |
| 50-80% | Moderate | Review which checks failed, fine-tune |
| 80-95% | Good | Minor tuning, monitor false positives |
| >95% | Excellent | Strong protection, watch for over-blocking |

The goal is not 100% blocking (that inevitably means false positives) but reducing attacks to manageable levels while keeping the door open for real players.

## Monitoring

### Log Analysis

Parse your server logs to spot attack patterns early:

```bash title="check-bot-attack.sh"
#!/bin/bash
THRESHOLD=50
LOG="/path/to/minecraft/logs/latest.log"

MAX_CONNECTS=$(grep "logged in" "$LOG" | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" | \
  awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')

if [ "$MAX_CONNECTS" -gt "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
  curl -X POST "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"content\": \"Bot attack detected: $MAX_CONNECTS connections from single IP\"}"
fi
```

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes via cron
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/check-bot-attack.sh
```

Track these metrics over time: blocks per hour, attack frequency, detection speed, TPS during attacks versus baseline, and the rate at which you're manually whitelisting false positives. If that last number is climbing, your thresholds are too aggressive.

## Conclusion

Anti-bot protection is an ongoing process. Attackers evolve, and your defenses need to keep pace. The key principles:

- **Layer your defenses** so no single bypass is fatal
- **Test before an attack forces you to**, using realistic bot traffic against an isolated copy of your server
- **Monitor continuously** so you catch attacks early and spot configuration drift
- **Balance security with accessibility** because the most secure server is one nobody can join, which defeats the purpose

Keep your plugins updated, review your logs, and re-test after every configuration change. Your legitimate players will thank you.
