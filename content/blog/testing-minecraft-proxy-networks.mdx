## Testing Minecraft Proxy Networks

A proxy sits between players and your backend servers, routing connections so players can switch between lobbies, survival worlds, and minigames without disconnecting. This guide covers how to set up, secure, and test proxy networks using [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) and [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/).

### Why Run a Proxy?

Without a proxy, each server is an island. Players disconnect, change the IP, and reconnect. A proxy gives them a single address and routes them between backend servers with `/server` commands -- no disconnect required. You also get one place to manage all players, the ability to spread load across machines, and backend IPs that stay hidden from the public internet.

A minimal network is one proxy, one lobby server, and one or more game servers. The proxy itself is lightweight (512MB--1GB of RAM) since it only routes packets. Backend servers need the usual resources based on their game mode and player count.

### Choosing a Proxy

<Tab value="velocity" label="Velocity" default>

[Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) is the modern choice, built by the PaperMC team. It uses a secure forwarding protocol by default (HMAC-signed player data), outperforms BungeeCord in benchmarks, and offers a clean plugin API. The ecosystem is smaller than BungeeCord's, but most popular plugins already have Velocity versions.

Use Velocity for any new network.

<Tab value="bungeecord" label="BungeeCord">

[BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) is the original proxy and still the most widely used. It has the largest plugin ecosystem and the most community documentation. The catch is that its legacy forwarding mode is less secure by design -- it relies on IP-based trust rather than cryptographic verification. Performance is fine, but it falls noticeably behind Velocity under load.

Use BungeeCord only if you depend on plugins that have no Velocity equivalent. Waterfall (PaperMC's BungeeCord fork) offers bug fixes but still uses the same legacy forwarding model and is mostly deprecated at this point.

## Setting Up Velocity

Download the latest build from the [PaperMC downloads page](https://papermc.io/downloads/velocity), then run it once to generate config files:

```bash title="Terminal"
java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -jar velocity.jar
```

### Proxy Configuration

The main config is `velocity.toml`:

```toml title="velocity.toml"
bind = "0.0.0.0:25577"
motd = "&bMy Minecraft Network"
show-max-players = 500
player-info-forwarding-mode = "modern"

[servers]
lobby = "127.0.0.1:25565"
survival = "127.0.0.1:25566"

try = ["lobby"]

[forced-hosts]
"survival.example.com" = ["survival"]
```

Velocity also generates a `forwarding.secret` file containing a random token. This shared secret is how the proxy proves to backends that a player is who they say they are.

<Callout type="warning" title="Forwarding Secret">
The forwarding secret is the single most important security credential in your network. If it leaks, an attacker can impersonate any player by connecting directly to a backend server with forged identity data. Generate a strong random value, keep it out of version control, and make sure it matches exactly between Velocity and every backend.
</Callout>

### Backend Server Configuration

Every backend server behind Velocity needs three changes:

**server.properties** -- disable online-mode so the proxy handles authentication, and bind to localhost so players can't bypass the proxy:

```properties title="server.properties"
online-mode=false
server-ip=127.0.0.1
server-port=25565
```

**spigot.yml** -- make sure BungeeCord mode is off (Velocity uses its own forwarding):

```yaml title="spigot.yml"
settings:
  bungeecord: false
```

**config/paper-global.yml** -- enable Velocity forwarding and paste the same secret from the proxy's `forwarding.secret` file:

```yaml title="paper-global.yml"
proxies:
  velocity:
    enabled: true
    online-mode: true
    secret: "paste-your-forwarding-secret-here"
```

Start the backend servers first, then start the proxy. Connect to `localhost:25577` and run `/glist` on the proxy console to confirm your bots or client appear on the correct backend.

## BungeeCord Setup

If you need BungeeCord instead, the setup is simpler but less secure:

```yaml title="config.yml"
listeners:
  - host: 0.0.0.0:25577
    max_players: 500
    force_default_server: true

ip_forward: true

servers:
  lobby:
    address: localhost:25565
    restricted: false
  survival:
    address: localhost:25566
    restricted: false

priorities:
  - lobby
```

On backends, set `online-mode=false` in server.properties and `bungeecord: true` in spigot.yml. Since BungeeCord's legacy forwarding trusts any connection from the proxy IP without cryptographic verification, you should also install [BungeeGuard](https://github.com/lucko/BungeeGuard) to add token-based authentication on top.

## Player Info Forwarding

Forwarding is how the proxy tells backend servers who a player actually is -- their username, UUID, and skin. This is the most dangerous part to mess up.

**Velocity Modern Forwarding** signs player data with an HMAC using the shared secret. The backend verifies the signature before accepting the connection. Without the secret, nobody can fake a player identity. This is the recommended mode.

**Legacy Forwarding** (BungeeCord and Velocity's legacy mode) sends player data as plain text in the handshake. The backend trusts it because the connection comes from the proxy's IP. If an attacker reaches a backend directly, they can forge any identity. You can patch this with firewalls and BungeeGuard, but modern forwarding is strictly better.

### Verifying Forwarding Works

After setup, verify these three things:

1. **Players get correct UUIDs.** Connect through the proxy and check your UUID on the backend (a plugin like Essentials shows it with `/whois`). It should match your Mojang/Microsoft UUID, not an offline-mode hash.

2. **Skins load correctly.** If forwarding is broken, skins won't transfer to backends.

3. **Direct backend connections are rejected.** Try connecting a client straight to `localhost:25565` (bypassing the proxy). With modern forwarding enabled, the backend should refuse the connection. If you can join with any username, your forwarding is broken.

## Testing the Network

### Functional Tests

Start with basic connectivity. Connect through the proxy, confirm you land in the lobby, then run `/server survival` and verify you switch cleanly. Try `/server nonexistent` and confirm you get an error without being disconnected. Stop a backend server while bots are connected and verify they either move to a fallback server (if configured in the `try` list) or get kicked with a clear message.

### Load Testing with Bots

Manual testing can't cover concurrent load. You need bots to validate that your proxy holds up when 50 or 100 players switch servers at the same time, connect in a burst, or stay online for hours.

SoulFire works well here. Point it at your proxy address, set a join delay of 1--2 seconds between bots, and start with 10--20 connections. Use the Chat Logger plugin to watch server messages and the Auto Reconnect plugin to test connection stability over time.

**What to test at scale:**

- **Connection bursts.** Connect 50 bots within 10 seconds. All should reach the lobby without errors.
- **Simultaneous switching.** With 50 bots in the lobby, have them all run `/server survival` at once. Monitor proxy and backend logs for errors. Check TPS on both servers during the migration.
- **Long-duration stability.** Leave 20 bots connected for several hours, periodically switching servers. Watch for memory leaks in the proxy, timeout disconnects, or gradual TPS degradation.
- **Backend failure recovery.** Kill a backend server while bots are on it. Verify fallback behavior.

**What to monitor:**

```bash title="Terminal"
# Player distribution across servers (on proxy console)
/glist

# Proxy errors in real time
tail -f velocity-proxy/logs/latest.log | grep -i error

# Backend TPS (on each backend, requires Spark)
/spark tps
```

In our testing, a properly configured Velocity proxy handles 100+ connections per second, switches servers in under 500ms, and stays under 1GB of RAM. If you see connection timeouts during bursts, increase `read-timeout` in the `[advanced]` section of velocity.toml. If switching is slow, check that backend spawn chunks are pregenerated and not causing lag on player join.

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't connect to downstream server"** -- The proxy can reach the backend but something fails during the handshake. Check that the backend is running, the port matches velocity.toml, `online-mode=false` is set, and the forwarding secret matches. Test raw connectivity with `telnet 127.0.0.1 25565` from the proxy machine.

**Wrong UUIDs or missing skins** -- Forwarding is misconfigured. Verify that velocity.toml uses `player-info-forwarding-mode = "modern"`, paper-global.yml has `velocity.enabled: true` with the correct secret, and spigot.yml has `bungeecord: false`. Restart everything after changes.

**Players can join backends directly** -- Your backends are exposed to the internet. Bind them to `127.0.0.1` in server.properties, or firewall the backend ports:

```bash title="Terminal"
# Allow only proxy IP, drop everything else
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -s PROXY_IP -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -j DROP
```

**Random disconnects** -- Usually network instability or aggressive timeouts. Increase `read-timeout` to 60000 in velocity.toml's `[advanced]` section. If the problem persists, check for packet loss on the network path between proxy and backends.

**Slow server switching** -- Commonly caused by backends generating terrain when players arrive. Pregenerate the spawn area with [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky). If backends are on different physical machines, network latency between them also adds to switch time.

### Conclusion

Misconfigured forwarding is a direct security vulnerability, and untested setups fall apart under real load. Set up modern forwarding, verify it works, lock down your backends, and load test with bots before you open to players.
