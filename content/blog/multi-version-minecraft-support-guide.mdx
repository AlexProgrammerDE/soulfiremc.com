## Understanding Protocol Versioning

Every Minecraft version uses a different network protocol. A 1.20 client cannot talk to a 1.21 server out of the box -- they simply don't speak the same language. Traditionally this means players must run the exact version the server is on, which fractures your player base every time Mojang ships an update.

The [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion) suite solves this by translating packets on the fly, so a single server can accept clients spanning from 1.8 all the way to the latest release.

## The ViaVersion Suite

ViaVersion isn't one plugin -- it's three, each covering a different direction of translation.

| Plugin | Direction | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **ViaVersion** | Newer clients -> older server | 1.21 client joins a 1.20 server |
| **ViaBackwards** | Older clients -> newer server | 1.19 client joins a 1.21 server |
| **ViaRewind** | Legacy clients -> modern server | 1.8 client joins a 1.21 server |

ViaBackwards requires ViaVersion. ViaRewind requires both. Install all three for maximum coverage.

```bash title="Terminal"
# Download the suite
wget https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion/releases/download/5.0.0/ViaVersion-5.0.0.jar
wget https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards/releases/download/5.0.0/ViaBackwards-5.0.0.jar
wget https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaRewind/releases/download/3.0.0/ViaRewind-3.0.0.jar

# Place all three in the plugins folder
mv ViaVersion-5.0.0.jar ViaBackwards-5.0.0.jar ViaRewind-3.0.0.jar plugins/
```

### Version Support Matrix

| Your Server | Plugins Installed | Client Support |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1.21 | ViaVersion only | 1.21+ |
| 1.21 | + ViaBackwards | ~1.16 - 1.21+ |
| 1.21 | + ViaBackwards + ViaRewind | 1.8 - 1.21+ |

<Callout type="info">
ViaBackwards covers roughly 3-4 major versions back. ViaRewind fills the gap down to 1.8, which remains popular for PvP servers.
</Callout>

## Configuration

### ViaVersion config.yml

```yaml title="ViaVersion config.yml"
checkforupdates: true
send-supported-versions: false
block-protocols: []
force-json-transform: false
suppress-metadata-errors: false
debug: false
minimize-cooldown: true
team-colour-fix: true
cache-values: false
character-width-fix: false
```

The settings that matter most:

| Setting | Recommended | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `debug` | false | Significant performance cost; enable only when troubleshooting |
| `team-colour-fix` | true | Fixes scoreboard colors across versions |
| `minimize-cooldown` | true | Better combat feel for older clients |

### ViaBackwards config.yml

```yaml title="ViaBackwards config.yml"
suppress-conversion-warnings: false
fix-fire-animation: true
shield-blocking: true
hologram-patch: true
sound-conversion: true
```

### Version-Specific Limitations

Not everything translates perfectly. Older clients will see approximations for content that didn't exist in their version.

| Feature | Introduced | Behavior on Older Clients |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| New blocks (copper, deepslate) | Varies | Rendered as a placeholder like stone |
| New items (netherite) | Varies | Shown as a similar older item |
| Extended world height | 1.18 | Clients &lt;1.18 cannot see below y=0 or above y=255 |
| New mobs (warden, allay) | Varies | Rendered as a different mob with correct hitbox |
| Hex chat colors | 1.16 | Fall back to nearest legacy color code |

## Proxy Multi-Version Support

On networks using [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) or [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/), installing ViaVersion on the proxy is the preferred approach. It translates once at the edge instead of on every backend server, and it lets backends run different Minecraft versions behind a single entry point.

<Tabs items={['Velocity', 'BungeeCord']}>
  <Tab value="Velocity">
```bash title="Installing on Velocity"
mv ViaVersion-5.0.0.jar velocity/plugins/
mv ViaBackwards-5.0.0.jar velocity/plugins/
mv ViaRewind-3.0.0.jar velocity/plugins/
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="BungeeCord">
```bash title="Installing on BungeeCord"
mv ViaVersion-5.0.0.jar bungeecord/plugins/
mv ViaBackwards-5.0.0.jar bungeecord/plugins/
mv ViaRewind-3.0.0.jar bungeecord/plugins/
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

A typical proxy network might have a 1.21 lobby, a 1.20.4 survival world, and a 1.19 creative world. With ViaVersion on the proxy, any client version can move between all three backends without reconnecting.

<Callout type="warning">
When combining ViaVersion with proxy-level protocol forwarding (e.g., Velocity modern forwarding), verify that UUIDs and skins resolve correctly for every client version. This is the most common source of subtle bugs.
</Callout>

## ViaFabricPlus (Client-Side)

[ViaFabricPlus](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabricPlus) is a client-side Fabric mod that lets a modern client connect to virtually any server version -- including Alpha, Beta, and even snapshots. A single client installation can verify connectivity against every version your server claims to support.

## Testing Multi-Version Support

Just installing the plugins isn't enough — you need to actually test it.

### What to Test

Cover these areas across your supported client versions:

- **Connection**: Client joins without errors, spawns normally, server console is clean.
- **Movement**: Walking, sprinting, jumping, and swimming feel correct. Some rubber-banding on 1.8 clients is expected due to physics prediction differences.
- **Blocks and items**: Newer content appears as placeholders on older clients. Collision and breaking still work.
- **Combat**: 1.8 clients use spam-clicking; 1.9+ clients use attack cooldowns. Both should register hits, but the feel will always differ. Consider [OldCombatMechanics](https://github.com/kernitus/BukkitOldCombatMechanics) if you want to normalize this.
- **Chat**: Messages and commands work. Avoid hex colors (`&#FF5555`) in messages sent to pre-1.16 clients; stick to legacy color codes (`&c`) for universal compatibility.
- **World height**: On 1.18+ servers, clients below 1.18 cannot see blocks outside the classic y=0-255 range. Build important structures within that safe zone.
- **Entities**: New mobs render as substitute mobs on old clients. Hitboxes and server-side AI remain correct.

### Minimum Test Matrix

Pick representative versions from each protocol era:

| Server Version | Test Clients |
|----------------|--------------|
| 1.21 | 1.21, 1.20.4, 1.19, 1.16.5, 1.12.2, 1.8.9 |

If all six connect and the core areas above work, your Via suite is configured correctly.

### Automating Tests with Bots

Manually launching six different client versions after every server update gets old fast. Bots solve this.

SoulFire includes [ViaFabricPlus](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabricPlus) integration, so a single SoulFire instance can connect as any protocol version. This makes it ideal for automated version sweeps:

1. Point SoulFire at your server.
2. Set the target protocol version (e.g., 1.16.5).
3. Launch a handful of bots and confirm they connect without protocol errors.
4. Repeat for each version in your test matrix.

For load testing, connect bots across multiple versions simultaneously -- for example, 5 bots each on 1.21, 1.20.4, 1.19, 1.16.5, 1.12.2, and 1.8.9 (30 bots total). Let them stay online for 15-30 minutes and monitor TPS. If the server holds 19-20 TPS with no protocol errors, your setup is solid.

## Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "Outdated client" on join | ViaBackwards missing | Install ViaBackwards |
| "Outdated server" on join | ViaVersion missing | Install ViaVersion |
| Blocks invisible | Normal for older clients seeing newer content | Use era-appropriate blocks in key areas |
| Movement rubber-banding | Physics prediction mismatch | Enable `minimize-cooldown` in ViaVersion config |
| Combat feels wrong | 1.8 vs 1.9+ attack system difference | Use OldCombatMechanics or document the expected behavior |
| Slow chunk loading | Protocol differences in chunk format | Expected; Paper's async chunk loading helps |
| Random disconnects | Unsupported protocol edge case | Update ViaVersion to latest and check GitHub issues |

## Performance

ViaVersion adds modest overhead: roughly 5-10% CPU for packet translation, 50-100 MB of RAM for caches, and 1-5 ms of added latency per translated packet. If you're running a large network (1000+ concurrent players) or extremely latency-sensitive competitive PvP, profile before and after installation.

To minimize overhead, keep `debug` off, disable `cache-values` if memory is tight, and always run the latest Via plugin versions -- they frequently include performance improvements.

## Wrapping Up

Multi-version support turns your server from "update or leave" into "just connect." Install the full ViaVersion suite, test a representative spread of client versions, and automate that testing with bots so you catch regressions early. The biggest gotchas -- world height on pre-1.18 clients, combat system differences, and block placeholders -- are well-understood and manageable once you know they exist. Keep your Via plugins up to date, validate after every server update, and your players will never have to think about version numbers again.
