## DonutSMP and the Real-Money Economy

DonutSMP is currently the largest Minecraft server in the world, regularly hitting 30,000+ concurrent players and peaking above 60,000. It's a hardcore survival server with PvP, raiding, and a surprisingly deep player-driven economy. Die once, and you're banned for two days.

What makes DonutSMP interesting from an automation perspective is that its economy has real monetary value. Players buy and sell in-game currency on third-party marketplaces at roughly $0.03-0.04 per million. That might sound tiny, but when you're generating billions per day across multiple bots, the numbers add up fast.

<Callout type="warning">
**These values fluctuate constantly.** DonutSMP's economy experiences heavy inflation, and third-party market rates shift daily. The numbers in this guide reflect approximate rates as of February 2026. Always check current prices before making decisions. Also note that real-money trading violates DonutSMP's terms of service and carries ban risk.

## How the Economy Works

DonutSMP runs on two currencies, three trading systems, and a sell multiplier that turns patient players into money printers.

### Currencies

| Currency | How You Earn It | What It Buys |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Money** | `/sell` items, auction house sales, filling `/orders` | Everything on `/ah`, player trades |
| **Shards** | AFK zone (1/min), kills (10/kill), Donut+ subscription | Mob spawners, crate keys via `/shop` |

### Trading Systems

| System | Command | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Auction House** | `/ah` | Buying and selling individual items, flipping |
| **Orders** | `/orders` | Bulk purchasing at below-market prices |
| **Direct Sell** | `/sell` | Selling items to the server at fixed rates (affected by multiplier) |

### The Sell Multiplier

This is the single most important mechanic for money generation. Your personal sell multiplier starts at 1.0x and climbs to 3.0x as you accumulate total sales. At max multiplier, you can order items cheaply through `/orders` and flip them via `/sell` for triple the base price. It's essentially infinite margin once you've ground your multiplier high enough.

Tools like [DonutCalc](https://donutcalc.com/) help plan the grind to 3.0x. The [DonutSMP Wiki](https://donutsmp.fandom.com/wiki/Sell_Multiplier) has the full breakdown of milestones.

## Money-Making Methods That Scale with Bots

Not every farming method benefits from automation. Here are the ones that do, ordered by how well they pair with SoulFire.

<Tabs items={['AFK Shards', 'Spawner Farms', 'Sell Arbitrage', 'AH Flipping']}>
  <Tab value="AFK Shards">
### AFK Shard Farming

The simplest method. Bots join the AFK zone with `/afk <lobby>` and idle. That's it. Each bot earns 1 shard per minute, or 1,440 shards per day. With a shard booster from an Amethyst crate, that jumps to 5,760 per day.

Shards themselves aren't directly tradeable, but they buy spawners from `/shop`. An Iron Golem spawner costs 1,500 shards, so one bot earns roughly one spawner per day. Spawners produce items you sell for money.

**Why it works with SoulFire:** Zero interaction needed after joining. The bot just has to stay connected. SoulFire's node scripting can handle reconnection on disconnect, lobby selection, and even auto-claiming shard rewards.

| Metric | Without Booster | With 4x Booster |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Shards/day/bot | 1,440 | 5,760 |
| Days per Iron Golem spawner | ~1.04 | ~0.26 |
| Spawners/month (10 bots) | ~288 | ~1,152 |
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Spawner Farms">
### Iron Golem Spawner Farms

This is the current meta for raw money generation. Iron Golem spawners produce iron, which sells for consistent prices. The top setups run 1,728 spawners and reportedly pull 800M/hr. Even a modest 100-spawner farm makes serious money.

The catch is that someone needs to be nearby to keep the chunks loaded. That's where SoulFire bots come in. They stand near the farm, collect drops periodically, and `/sell` them. The farm runs 24/7 as long as the bot stays online.

**Why it works with SoulFire:** Bots act as chunk loaders and item collectors. Node scripts can handle periodic inventory collection, selling, and reconnection after deaths or disconnects.

| Farm Size | Estimated Income/hr | Daily (24h) | Monthly |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| 100 spawners | ~46M | ~1.1B | ~33B |
| 500 spawners | ~230M | ~5.5B | ~165B |
| 1,728 spawners | ~800M | ~19.2B | ~576B |
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Sell Arbitrage">
### Sell Multiplier Arbitrage

Once your sell multiplier hits 3.0x, you can buy items through `/orders` at base price and `/sell` them for triple. The margin is built into the game's own mechanics.

The bot places bulk orders for cheap items (kelp blocks, iron, bones), waits for other players to fill them, collects the deliveries, and runs `/sell`. Rinse and repeat.

**Why it works with SoulFire:** The entire loop can be scripted. Place order, wait, collect from GUI, sell, repeat. Node scripting handles the GUI interactions through inventory click nodes.

The main bottleneck is order fill speed. Popular items get filled quickly, but niche items might sit for hours. A smart script rotates through multiple item types.
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="AH Flipping">
### Auction House Flipping

New players constantly list items below market value on `/ah`. Buy low, sell high. Classic arbitrage.

DonutSMP has a [public API](https://api.donutsmp.net/index.html) and community tools like [donut.auction](https://donut.auction/) and [donutstats.net](https://www.donutstats.net/) that track price history. A bot that knows current market prices can snipe underpriced listings faster than any human.

**Why it works with SoulFire:** The Web Fetch node can query price APIs. Combined with chat parsing and inventory interaction, a script can monitor the AH, detect deals, and buy them automatically.

## How SoulFire's Node Scripting Makes This Possible

SoulFire isn't a simple autoclicker. It runs actual Minecraft client code built on Fabric, so the server can't distinguish it from a real player by protocol alone. But the real power is in the visual node scripting system, which lets you build complex automation without writing a single line of code.

### What the Scripting System Can Do

The node editor gives you 179+ nodes across categories like bot control, inventory management, chat interaction, world queries, and even external API calls. You connect them visually, like wiring up a circuit.

Here's what matters for DonutSMP farming:

| Capability | Relevant Nodes | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Send commands** | Send Chat | `/sell`, `/ah`, `/orders`, `/afk`, `/shop` |
| **Read chat** | On Chat, String Contains, Regex Match | Parse sell confirmations, order notifications |
| **Manage inventory** | Open Inventory, Click Slot, Get Inventory | Interact with shop GUIs, collect order deliveries |
| **Stay alive** | On Damage, Get Health, Use Item | Eat food when low, equip armor |
| **Navigate** | Pathfind To, Get Position | Walk to AFK zone, move between farm and sell point |
| **Query APIs** | Web Fetch, Parse JSON | Check live market prices from donut.auction |
| **Reconnect** | On Disconnect, On Join | Auto-rejoin after kicks or deaths |
| **Track state** | Persistent Variables, Session Variables | Remember sell multiplier progress, earnings |
| **Alert you** | Discord Webhook | Notify on death, ban, or earnings milestones |

### Example: AFK Shard Farmer Script

A basic shard farming setup only needs a handful of nodes:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Connect and Navigate

Use the **On Join** trigger to detect when the bot enters the server. Connect it to a **Send Chat** node that runs `/afk 1` to teleport to the AFK lobby. Add a short **Wait** node before the command to let the connection stabilize.

</Step>
<Step>

### Handle Disconnects

Add an **On Disconnect** trigger that connects to a **Wait** node (30 seconds to avoid rapid reconnection loops), then the bot automatically reconnects. SoulFire handles the actual reconnection logic. The script just needs to re-run the `/afk` command on the next **On Join** event.

</Step>
<Step>

### Monitor and Alert

Wire an **On Interval** trigger (every hour) to a **Discord Webhook** node that posts the bot's current shard count and uptime. That way you know everything's running without checking manually.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Spawner Farm Operator

This one's more involved. The bot needs to stand near the farm, periodically open collection chests, grab items, and sell them.

```
On Interval (every 5 min)
  → Get Position (verify bot is at farm)
  → Branch (at farm?)
    → Yes: Open Inventory → Click Slot (collect items) → Close Inventory
           → Wait (1s) → Send Chat ("/sell all")
    → No: Pathfind To (farm coordinates)
           → loop back to collect step

On Damage
  → Get Health → Compare (< 8?)
    → Yes: Use Item (golden apple) → select food slot first
    → No: continue

On Death
  → Discord Webhook ("Bot died, waiting for respawn ban")
```

### Example: Market-Aware AH Flipper

This is the most advanced setup, combining external API calls with in-game actions:

```
On Interval (every 30s)
  → Web Fetch (donut.auction API for current prices)
  → Parse JSON (extract item prices into variables)
  → Send Chat ("/ah") → parse results from chat
  → For Each (listed item)
    → Compare (listed price < market price * 0.7?)
      → Yes: buy the item
      → No: skip
  → Web Fetch (log purchase to external tracker)
```

The **Web Fetch** node supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE with full header and body control. You can integrate with any external API, whether that's a price tracker, a Discord bot, or your own dashboard.

## Scaling Up

Running one bot is a proof of concept. Running 10+ is where things get interesting. A few considerations for scaling:

### Multi-Account Management

SoulFire is designed to run many bots simultaneously from a single instance. Each bot runs its own script independently. You can assign different scripts to different bots, so some farm shards while others operate spawner farms.

### Proxy Rotation

DonutSMP tracks IPs and can ban "associated accounts." Running all your bots from one IP is a quick way to lose everything. SoulFire supports SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies natively, so you can route each bot through a different residential proxy.

### The Death Problem

Hardcore mode means any death results in a 2-day ban. For AFK shard farming this isn't a huge concern since the AFK zone is relatively safe. But for bots operating in the overworld near farms, other players can and will kill them for loot. Your scripts need solid damage detection and escape logic, or you accept the occasional 2-day downtime per bot.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Bot detection by anti-cheat | Medium | SoulFire uses real client code, reducing protocol-level detection |
| Admin manual review | High | Vary bot behavior, don't run identical patterns |
| IP-based ban waves | High | Use residential proxies, one per bot |
| Death in hardcore mode | Medium | Script damage detection, keep bots in safe areas |
| Economy crashes | Low | Diversify methods, cash out regularly |
| ToS enforcement | High | Accept the risk or don't participate |

<Callout type="danger">
Real-money trading on DonutSMP explicitly violates their terms of service. Getting caught means permanent bans across all associated accounts. This guide explains what's technically possible, not what's endorsed. You assume all risk.

## Third-Party Market Landscape

For context, here's where DonutSMP currency and items trade hands outside the server. These marketplaces operate in a gray area and listings change constantly.

| Platform | What's Sold | Approximate Rates |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Eldorado.gg](https://www.eldorado.gg/donutsmp-money/g/278) | Money, items, accounts, boosting services | From $0.04/M |
| [Odealo](https://odealo.com/games/donut-smp/marketplace) | Money, items, accounts | Varies |
| eBay | Money, spawners, accounts | $0.03-0.07/M depending on quantity |
| Various `.market` sites | Money, spawners, bases | Varies |

Eldorado also lists **boosting services** where sellers will AFK farm, build bases, or dig for you. That's essentially what you'd be automating with SoulFire, but doing it yourself instead of paying someone.

The market supports the idea that there's real demand here. People pay for in-game currency and services, and the supply side is where bots fit in.

## Getting Started

If you want to experiment with this, start small. One bot, AFK shard farming, no real-money trading. Get comfortable with the node scripting system, understand how DonutSMP's mechanics work firsthand, and build up from there.

The [SoulFire scripting documentation](/docs/scripting) covers the full node reference, and the [examples page](/docs/scripting/examples) has starter workflows you can adapt. For DonutSMP-specific economy data, [donut.auction](https://donut.auction/) and [donutsmpstats.net](https://donutsmpstats.net/) are the best live resources.
