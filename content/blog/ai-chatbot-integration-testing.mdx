## AI Chatbots in Minecraft

Instead of static signs and pre-written FAQs, you can give players a server assistant that answers questions in natural language, NPCs that hold actual conversations, and moderation that catches nuance rather than keyword lists. This guide covers how to set one up, which LLM providers work well, and how to test the integration before your players find the edge cases for you.

### Choosing an LLM Provider

The first decision is where your AI runs. The trade-offs come down to cost, quality, and privacy.

<Tabs items={["OpenAI GPT", "Anthropic Claude", "Ollama (Self-Hosted)"]}>
  <Tab value="OpenAI GPT">

The most established option. The GPT-4.1 family hits a good balance of cost and quality for server chatbots — GPT-4.1-mini is the sweet spot for most use cases. GPT-5 exists and is more capable, but it's overkill and more expensive for answering "how do I claim land?" questions.

**Trade-offs:** Requires an API key and internet connection. GPT-4.1-mini runs about $0.40/million input tokens; GPT-4.1-nano is even cheaper at $0.10/million. You're sending player chat data to OpenAI's servers, which may matter depending on your server's privacy stance.

```java title="GPTChatBot.java"
public class GPTChatBot {
    private static final String API_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions";

    public String askGPT(String question) {
        JSONObject requestBody = new JSONObject();
        requestBody.put("model", "gpt-4.1-mini");

        JSONArray messages = new JSONArray();
        messages.put(new JSONObject()
            .put("role", "system")
            .put("content", "You are a helpful Minecraft server assistant.")
        );
        messages.put(new JSONObject()
            .put("role", "user")
            .put("content", question)
        );

        requestBody.put("messages", messages);
        // Send HTTP request async, parse response
    }
}
```

  <Tab value="Anthropic Claude">

Another cloud option. In our testing, Claude tends to hold character better over long NPC conversations — it's less likely to break persona mid-dialogue than GPT.

**Trade-offs:** Similar cost structure to OpenAI. Claude Sonnet 4.5 runs $3/million input tokens, $15/million output tokens. Claude Haiku 4.5 is cheaper at $1/$5 if you don't need top-tier quality.

```java title="ClaudeChatBot.java"
public class ClaudeChatBot {
    private static final String API_URL = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages";

    public String askClaude(String question) {
        JSONObject requestBody = new JSONObject();
        requestBody.put("model", "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929");
        requestBody.put("max_tokens", 1024);

        JSONArray messages = new JSONArray();
        messages.put(new JSONObject()
            .put("role", "user")
            .put("content", question)
        );

        requestBody.put("messages", messages);
        // Send HTTP request async, parse response
    }
}
```

  <Tab value="Ollama (Self-Hosted)">

Runs LLMs locally on your hardware. No API costs, no rate limits, and player data never leaves your server.

**Trade-offs:** Requires a capable machine. An 8B parameter model needs at least 8GB of RAM and benefits from a GPU. Response quality is lower than the cloud APIs, but good enough for answering server questions and running NPC dialogue. A big recent addition is [GPT-OSS](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss) — OpenAI's open-weight model that runs locally and punches well above its weight.

```bash title="Terminal"
# Install and start Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
ollama serve
```

```java title="OllamaChatBot.java"
public class OllamaChatBot {
    private static final String OLLAMA_URL = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate";

    public String askOllama(String question) {
        JSONObject requestBody = new JSONObject();
        requestBody.put("model", "gpt-oss:20b");
        requestBody.put("prompt", question);
        requestBody.put("stream", false);
        // Send HTTP POST, parse JSON response
    }
}
```

| Model | Parameters | Min RAM | GPU |
|-------|------------|---------|-----|
| GPT-OSS 20B | 21B (3.6B active) | 16GB | Optional |
| Llama 4 8B | 8B | 8GB | Optional |
| Qwen3 8B | 8B | 8GB | Optional |
| Gemma 3 4B | 4B | 6GB | Optional |

### Plugin Configuration

Most AI chat plugins follow the same pattern: define a trigger keyword, set up a system prompt, configure rate limiting, and point at your LLM provider. Here's a typical configuration:

```yaml title="config.yml"
provider: "ollama"  # or "openai", "claude"

ollama:
  url: "http://localhost:11434"
  model: "mistral"
  timeout: 30

trigger: "@ai"  # Players type "@ai question here"

system-prompt: |
  You are a helpful assistant on a Minecraft server.
  Answer questions about the server, game mechanics, and help players.
  Keep responses concise (1-3 sentences).
  Be friendly and encouraging.

use-context: true
context-messages: 5  # Remember last 5 messages per player

cooldown: 10  # seconds between requests per player

content-filter:
  enabled: true
  response: "I'm here to help with server questions only!"
```

The system prompt is where most of the value lies. A specific prompt that includes your server's IP, rules, economy system, and custom commands produces an assistant that actually helps — a generic "You are a helpful assistant" prompt produces generic answers.

### Crafting System Prompts

**Server assistant example:**

```yaml title="config.yml"
system-prompt: |
  You are Steve, the helpful server assistant bot.

  Server info:
  - IP: play.example.com
  - Type: Survival with economy
  - Rules: No griefing, cheating, or toxicity
  - Currency: Coins earned by playing
  - Claiming: /claim command, costs 10 coins per chunk

  Guidelines:
  - Be friendly and concise (1-3 sentences)
  - Direct complex questions to staff (/helpop command)
  - If you don't know an answer, say "I'm not sure, please ask staff with /helpop"
```

**Roleplay NPC example:**

```yaml title="config.yml"
entities:
  wizard_npc:
    system-prompt: |
      You are Eldrin, an ancient wizard who runs the magic shop.
      Personality: Wise, slightly mysterious, occasionally cryptic.
      Background: 500 years old, studied at the Arcane Academy.

      Speech patterns:
      - Start sentences with "Ah," or "Indeed,"
      - Reference "the old ways" occasionally
      - Speak in slightly formal English

      If asked to do something you can't: "That is beyond even my considerable powers..."
```

For NPC interactions, mods like CreatureChat (Fabric/Forge) let you assign AI personalities to individual mobs and entities, each with their own context and behavior constraints.

### AI-Assisted Moderation

Beyond chat assistance, AI can monitor messages for patterns that keyword filters miss:

```java title="ChatModerationPlugin.java"
@EventHandler
public void onChat(AsyncPlayerChatEvent event) {
    String message = event.getMessage();
    String analysis = analyzeChatMessage(message);

    // AI returns structured analysis:
    // { "toxic": false, "spam": false, "scam": false, "confidence": 0.95 }

    if (analysis.toxic && confidence > 0.8) {
        event.setCancelled(true);
        player.sendMessage("Please keep chat respectful!");
        logToModerators(player, message, "Toxic language detected");
    }
}
```

AI moderation catches subtle patterns: a player saying "nice base, would be a shame if something happened to it" is a grief threat that no keyword filter would flag. It also handles scam detection, spam patterns, and multi-language toxicity without maintaining enormous word lists.

<Callout type="warning">
AI moderation should flag and log, not auto-ban. Let staff make the final call on serious actions. False positives are inevitable, especially early on.
</Callout>

## Testing AI Chat Integration

Here's what to actually test.

### Functional Testing

Start with the basics: does the AI respond at all, and are the responses useful?

- **Trigger recognition**: Send `@ai hello` and verify a response arrives within a reasonable window (under 5 seconds for cloud, under 10 for self-hosted).
- **Response quality**: Ask server-specific questions ("How do I claim land?", "What's the server IP?") and verify the answers match your system prompt's knowledge.
- **Context persistence**: Send a multi-turn conversation and check that follow-up questions reference previous answers correctly. Ask "What biomes are near spawn?", then "Which has the best resources?" -- the AI should connect these.
- **Multi-language**: If your server is international, verify the AI responds in the player's language.

If any of these fail, the issue is almost always in the system prompt or the provider configuration, not the plugin itself.

### Safety and Rate Limiting

<Callout type="info">
Without rate limiting, a single player can burn through your API budget in minutes. This isn't optional for cloud-hosted LLMs.
</Callout>

- **Cooldown enforcement**: Send two queries back-to-back and verify the second is blocked with a cooldown message. Wait the configured interval and verify the next query succeeds.
- **Content filtering**: Send queries that should be rejected and verify the AI declines gracefully rather than engaging.
- **Conversation isolation**: Have two players ask questions simultaneously and verify their responses are not mixed up.

### Load Testing with Bots

Manual testing covers functionality, but it can't tell you what happens when 50 players ask questions at the same time during a server event.

**What to measure:**

Connect 10-50 bots using a tool like [SoulFire](https://soulfiremc.com) and have them send AI queries simultaneously. Track:

- **Response time distribution**: Average, median, 95th percentile, and maximum. Target under 5 seconds average, under 10 for 95th percentile.
- **Success rate**: What percentage of queries actually get answered? Anything below 95% indicates a queueing or timeout problem.
- **Server TPS impact**: AI processing should not drag down server performance. If TPS drops below 18 during the test, the plugin is likely doing synchronous work on the main thread.
- **AI service resource usage**: Monitor CPU and RAM on whatever is running your LLM. If Ollama hits 85%+ CPU during load tests, you'll need to scale or queue more aggressively before a real event.

**Interpreting results:**

If all queries are answered but response times climb linearly with bot count, the system is queueing properly but may need a faster model or additional capacity. If queries start timing out entirely, check whether the plugin has a proper request queue or is dropping requests under load.

### Regression Testing

Every time you update a system prompt, swap models, or upgrade the plugin, re-run your test suite. AI doesn't give the same answer twice, so the goal isn't identical responses but consistent quality. Keep a list of 20-30 representative questions and spot-check the answers after each change.

## Production Considerations

A few things that are easy to overlook before going live:

- **Fallback behavior**: What happens when your LLM provider is down? The plugin should either queue requests or tell the player to try again later, not silently fail.
- **Conversation logging**: Log AI interactions for debugging and prompt improvement, but be transparent with players about it.
- **Cost monitoring**: For cloud LLMs, set up billing alerts. A popular server can generate thousands of queries per day.
- **Prompt iteration**: Your first system prompt won't be your best. Review logs regularly and refine based on what players actually ask versus what the AI actually answers.

Plan on rewriting your system prompt at least a few times in the first month. Check your logs regularly, see what players are actually asking, and adjust accordingly.
