## AI Chatbots in Minecraft

AI chatbots transform Minecraft servers from static worlds to dynamic, responsive environments. From helpful assistants answering player questions to intelligent NPCs with personality, AI brings life to your server.

### Use Cases

**Player Support Bot**
```
Player: "How do I claim land?"
AI Bot: "Use /claim while standing in the area you want to protect. You start with 100 claim blocks and earn more by playing!"
```

**Lore/Story NPC**
```
Player: "Tell me about the ancient temple"
Wizard NPC (AI): "Ah, the Temple of Eternity... built centuries ago by the Skyborn civilization. Legend says it holds a powerful artifact..."
```

**Moderation Assistant**
```
AI monitors chat, flags suspicious behavior:
- Repeated spam patterns
- Toxic language
- Scam attempts
- Rule violations
```

**Mini-game Host**
```
AI Bot: "Welcome to Trivia Night! First question: Which block is only found in the Nether?"
Player: "Netherrack?"
AI Bot: "Correct! +10 points!"
```

### Benefits

|---------|-------------|
| **24/7 Availability** | Never sleeps, always ready to help |
| **Instant Responses** | No waiting for staff |
| **Consistent Information** | Same answer to same question |
| **Language Support** | Can respond in multiple languages |
| **Scalability** | Handles unlimited simultaneous conversations |

## AI Chat Technologies

### Cloud-Based LLMs

**OpenAI GPT (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)**

**Pros:**
- Extremely high quality responses
- Broad knowledge
- Strong reasoning
- Supports chat history/context

**Cons:**
- Requires API key
- Costs money per request (GPT-4: ~$0.01/1K tokens)
- Requires internet
- Privacy concerns (data sent to OpenAI)

**Setup:**

```java
// Using OpenAI API in Minecraft plugin
public class GPTChatBot {
    private static final String API_KEY = "sk-...";
    private static final String API_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions";

    public String askGPT(String question) {
        JSONObject requestBody = new JSONObject();
        requestBody.put("model", "gpt-3.5-turbo");

        JSONArray messages = new JSONArray();
        messages.put(new JSONObject()
            .put("role", "system")
            .put("content", "You are a helpful Minecraft server assistant.")
        );
        messages.put(new JSONObject()
            .put("role", "user")
            .put("content", question)
        );

        requestBody.put("messages", messages);

        // Send HTTP request (async recommended)
        // Parse response
        // Return AI's answer
    }
}
```

**Anthropic Claude**

Similar to GPT, alternative provider:
- Strong reasoning
- Good at following instructions
- Costs similar to GPT

### Self-Hosted LLMs (Ollama)

**Ollama** runs LLMs locally on your server.

**Pros:**
- Free (no API costs)
- Private (data stays on your server)
- Offline capable
- No rate limits

**Cons:**
- Requires powerful hardware (GPU recommended)
- Quality lower than GPT-4
- Setup more complex
- Resource intensive

**Installation:**

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Download a model
ollama pull llama2  # 7B parameter model
# or
ollama pull mistral  # Faster, good quality
# or
ollama pull codellama  # Good for technical questions

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

| Model | Parameters | RAM Needed | GPU Needed |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| Llama2 7B | 7 billion | 8GB | Optional |
| Llama2 13B | 13 billion | 16GB | Recommended |
| Mistral 7B | 7 billion | 8GB | Optional |

**Minecraft Integration:**

```java
public class OllamaChatBot {
    private static final String OLLAMA_URL = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate";

    public String askOllama(String question) {
        JSONObject requestBody = new JSONObject();
        requestBody.put("model", "mistral");
        requestBody.put("prompt", question);
        requestBody.put("stream", false);

        // Send HTTP POST request
        // Parse JSON response
        // Return response field
    }
}
```

      - Speak in slightly formal English

      Knowledge:
      - You know all enchantments
      - You know potion recipes
      - You remember old server history/lore

      If asked to do something you can't: "That is beyond even my considerable powers..."
```

### Minigame Host

```yaml
system-prompt: |
  You are the host of Trivia Tuesday on the server.

  Style: Energetic, encouraging, fun
  Tone: Upbeat game show host

  You run trivia about:
  - Minecraft mechanics

  - Keep track of scores
  - Congratulate correct answers enthusiastically
  - Encourage wrong answers: "Not quite, but good try!"

  Keep questions appropriate for all ages.
```

## AI Moderation Assistance

AI can help detect problematic behavior.

### Chat Monitoring

```java
@EventHandler
public void onChat(AsyncPlayerChatEvent event) {
    String message = event.getMessage();

    // Send to AI for analysis
    String analysis = analyzeChatMessage(message);

    // AI returns JSON
    // {
    //   "toxic": false,
    //   "spam": false,
    //   "scam": false,
    //   "confidence": 0.95
    // }

    if (analysis.toxic && confidence > 0.8) {
        event.setCancelled(true);
        player.sendMessage("Please keep chat respectful!");
        logToModerators(player, message, "Toxic language detected");
    }
}
```

### Pattern Detection

AI excels at finding patterns humans miss:

```
Normal: "Check out this cool build!"
Spam: "JOIN FREECOINS.SCAM FOR FREE RANKS!!!"  ← AI detects

Normal: "Anyone want to trade?"
Scam: "I'm Notch give me your password for free diamonds"  ← AI detects

Normal: "Can someone help me?"
Grief threat: "nice base would be a shame if something happened to it"  ← AI detects
```

## Testing AI Chatbots with Bots

Manual testing of AI chat requires many queries. Bots automate this.

### Why Bots for AI Testing?

**Manual testing limitations:**
- Can't test 50 simultaneous queries
- Tedious to test hundreds of questions
- Hard to measure response time consistently

**Bot testing benefits:**
- Test concurrent load (10, 50, 100 simultaneous requests)
- Automated query library (test same questions consistently)
- Performance benchmarking (accurate timing)
- Regression testing (verify updates don't break AI)

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Response Time Benchmark**

```
Objective: Measure AI response latency

Setup:
- 10 bots connected
- List of 100 test questions

Test:
1. Each bot sends 10 questions (100 total)
2. Measure time from send to response received
3. Calculate statistics

Metrics:
- Average response time
- Median response time
- 95th percentile (slowest 5%)
- Max response time

Target:
- Average: <3 seconds
- 95th percentile: <10 seconds
- No timeouts
```

**Scenario 2: Concurrent Load Test**

```
Objective: AI handles multiple simultaneous queries

Setup:
- 50 bots connected

Test:
1. All 50 bots send @ai query at same time
2. Monitor queue, response times
3. Check for errors or crashes

Expected:
- All queries eventually answered
- No crashes
- Graceful queueing
```

**Scenario 3: Context Persistence Test**

```
Objective: AI maintains conversation context

Setup:
- 1 bot connected
- Multi-turn conversation script

Test:
Bot sends sequence:
1. "@ai What's the server IP?"
2. [Wait for response]
3. "@ai Thanks! What's the best way to get there?"
4. [Wait for response]
5. "@ai And what should I bring?"

Expected:
- Response 2 understands "get there" means "to the server"
- Response 3 continues context logically
```

**Scenario 4: Spam Prevention Test**

```
Objective: Rate limiting works

Setup:
- 1 bot connected
- Cooldown set to 10 seconds

Test:
1. Bot sends @ai query
2. Immediately sends another (within cooldown)
3. Verify blocked
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Send another
6. Verify allowed

Expected:
- Query 2 blocked with cooldown message
- Query 3 succeeds
```

**Scenario 5: Content Filter Test**

```
Objective: Inappropriate queries rejected

Setup:
- Bot with test query list including edge cases

Test:
Bot sends queries:
- Normal: "@ai how do I craft?"
- Borderline: "@ai what's the best weapon?"
- Inappropriate: [filtered content]

Expected:
- Normal queries answered
- Inappropriate queries politely declined
- Borderline queries handled appropriately
```

### Using Bots for AI Chat Testing

Bots can send chat messages and monitor responses, enabling automated AI testing.

**Basic Test Configuration:**

```
Setup:
- 5 bots connected
- Auto-Chat plugin enabled
- Message list: Test questions for AI

Test Flow:
1. Bot 1 sends: "@ai how do I claim land?"
2. Bot waits for AI response
3. Bot logs response time and content
4. Bot 2 sends next question
5. Repeat through question list

Logging:
[2026-02-11 14:32:10] Bot1 -> @ai how do I claim land?
[2026-02-11 14:32:13] AI -> Use /claim while standing in area... (3.2s)
[2026-02-11 14:32:15] Bot2 -> @ai what's the economy?
[2026-02-11 14:32:18] AI -> We use coins as currency... (2.9s)
```

**Performance Benchmarking:**

```
Test: 100 AI queries, measure response time

Configuration:
- 10 bots
- Each sends 10 questions
- Questions sent sequentially (wait for response)

Results:
Questions: 100
Successful: 98
Failed: 2 (timeout)
Avg response time: 4.2s
Median: 3.8s
95th percentile: 8.1s
Max: 12.4s

Interpretation:
✅ Good: 98% success rate
⚠️ Warning: 2 timeouts (investigate AI service)
✅ Good: Average under 5s
⚠️ Acceptable: 95th percentile under 10s (some slow queries)
```

**Stress Testing:**

```
Test: Concurrent query load

Configuration:
- 50 bots
- All send @ai query within 1 second

Monitor:
- How many queries answered?
- Response time distribution
- Server TPS impact
- AI service CPU/RAM

Results:
Queries sent: 50
Queries answered: 50
Time to answer all: 45 seconds
TPS during test: 18-20 (acceptable)
AI service CPU: 85% (near capacity)

Interpretation:
✅ All queries answered (queue working)
⚠️ 45 seconds for 50 queries = ~1s per query (queueing adds delay)
⚠️ High CPU on AI service (may need scaling)
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Choose appropriate model**: GPT-4 for quality, Ollama for privacy/cost
2. **Craft good system prompts**: Specific personality, knowledge, and constraints
3. **Implement rate limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
4. **Use context wisely**: Balance memory vs. API costs
5. **Filter content**: Block inappropriate queries
6. **Monitor performance**: Track response times and errors
7. **Test with load**: Ensure AI handles peak traffic
8. **Have fallbacks**: What happens if AI service is down?
9. **Log conversations**: Debug and improve prompts
10. **Respect privacy**: Be transparent about AI data collection

## Conclusion

AI chatbots transform Minecraft servers from static worlds to dynamic, responsive communities. From player support to roleplay NPCs to moderation assistance, AI adds intelligence and personality that elevates the player experience.

Key takeaways:

1. **Multiple options**: Cloud (GPT) for quality, self-hosted (Ollama) for privacy/cost
2. **System prompts** define personality and knowledge
