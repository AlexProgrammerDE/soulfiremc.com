<Callout type="info">
  SoulFire's scripting system is a **visual node-based editor**, similar to Unreal Engine Blueprints or Blender's Geometry Nodes, but designed for Minecraft bots. No programming experience required.
</Callout>

## What is visual scripting?

Instead of writing code, you build bot behaviors by connecting **nodes** in a visual graph.
Each node performs a specific action, whether that's listening for events, making decisions, controlling bots, or processing data.
You connect nodes together by dragging edges between their ports, and SoulFire handles the rest.

The script editor is built right into the SoulFire client. Open any instance, go to the **Scripts** tab, and start building.

### How it works

1. **Triggers** start your script when something happens: a chat message arrives, a bot joins, a timer fires
2. **Data flows** along the edges between nodes, carrying values like messages, positions, or bot references
3. **Logic nodes** make decisions: check conditions, branch execution, loop over items
4. **Action nodes** control your bots: send chat messages, pathfind to coordinates, attack entities, place blocks
5. **The engine runs reactively**: scripts don't loop continuously, they respond to events as they happen

### Key features

- **70+ built-in nodes** across 12 categories, from basic math to AI chat completions
- **9 event triggers** that respond to chat messages, deaths, damage, ticks, timers, and more
- **Real-time execution logs** so you can watch your script run node by node with live output
- **Node debugging** to inspect values flowing through any connection
- **AI/LLM integration** with built-in nodes for OpenAI chat completions
- **HTTP requests** to call external APIs and webhooks from your scripts
- **Persistent state** to store data per-script or per-bot across sessions
- **Import/Export** to share scripts as JSON files
- **Keyboard shortcuts** with 20+ shortcuts for power users (Shift+A to quick-add, Ctrl+G to group, M to mute)

## Quick start: your first script

Here's how to build a simple auto-greeter that welcomes players when your bot joins a server:

1. Open the SoulFire client and navigate to your instance
2. Go to the **Scripts** tab and click **Create Script**
3. Give it a name like "Auto Greeter"
4. In the editor, press **Shift+A** to open the quick-add menu
5. Search for **On Join** and place it on the canvas (this is your trigger)
6. Press **Shift+A** again and add a **Send Chat** action node
7. Connect the **exec** output port of "On Join" to the **exec** input port of "Send Chat"
8. In the Send Chat node's settings, type your welcome message (e.g., `Hello everyone!`)
9. Click **Save**, then hit the **Play** button to activate your script

That's it. When your bot joins a server, it will automatically send the greeting. You can watch it happen in real-time in the **Execution Log** panel at the bottom of the editor.

## Core concepts

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of your scripts. Each node has:

- **Input ports** on the left side to receive data or execution signals
- **Output ports** on the right side to send data or execution signals
- A **category color**: orange for triggers, green for actions, blue for logic, purple for flow control, etc.

### Edges

Edges are the connections between nodes. There are two types:

- **Execution edges** control the order that nodes run (like a program's control flow)
- **Data edges** carry values between nodes (numbers, strings, bots, lists, etc.)

### Ports

Ports are the connection points on nodes. Each port has a type:

| Port Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Exec | Controls execution order | "Run this node next" |
| Number | Numeric values | Health, coordinates, counts |
| String | Text values | Chat messages, player names |
| Boolean | True/false values | Condition results |
| Bot | Bot references | Which bot to control |
| List | Collections of values | All connected bots |
| Block | Minecraft block types | Stone, dirt, diamond ore |
| Entity | Entity references | Players, mobs |
| Item | Item types | Diamond sword, golden apple |
| Vector3 | 3D coordinates | Positions in the world |

### Triggers

Triggers are special nodes that start your script's execution. A script does nothing until a trigger fires. You can have multiple triggers in one script, and each one starts its own independent execution chain.

### Execution model

SoulFire scripts are **reactive**, not imperative. Instead of running in a loop, scripts wait for triggers to fire and then execute the connected node chain. This means:

- Scripts use minimal resources when idle
- Multiple trigger events can run in parallel (up to 8 concurrent branches)
- Each trigger invocation gets its own isolated state
- Errors in one execution don't affect others
