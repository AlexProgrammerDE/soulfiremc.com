## Who needs a GUI?

A GUI is good for beginners, the GUI mode allows you to take full advantage of all features SoulFire offers.

This guide expects that you have SoulFire already installed and running on your machine.
If you haven't done that yet, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation)

## Starting the GUI

When you first launch SoulFire, you'll see a connection screen with three options:

- **Integrated server (local)**: Runs SoulFire on your machine. Recommended for beginners.
- **Dedicated server (remote)**: Connect to a remote SoulFire server using an address and token.
- **Demo server**: Try out the SoulFire interface without installing anything.

For beginners, it is recommended to select `Integrated server (local)`.
This means that SoulFire will run on your machine instead of controlling a remote server.

If you are a power-user wanting to learn more about why and how to set up a remote server, follow the [Dedicated Mode guide](/docs/guides/dedicated-mode).

## Dashboard

After connecting, you'll see the main dashboard. The interface is organized into several sections accessible from the left sidebar:

### User Section

- **Instances**: View and manage your bot instances. Each instance is an independent bot session configuration.
- **Access**: Manage access permissions and tokens.
- **Settings**: Configure user-specific settings.

### Admin Section

If you have admin privileges, you'll also see:

- **Overview**: Server overview and status.
- **Logs**: View server logs.
- **Terminal**: Execute commands directly on the server.
- **Users**: Manage user accounts.
- **Scripts**: Manage server-side scripts.
- **Server Settings**: Configure server behavior.
- **Dev Settings**: Advanced developer settings.

## Creating an Instance

To start your first bot session, you need to create an instance:

1. Click on **Instances** in the sidebar
2. Click the **Create Instance** button (+ icon)
3. Give your instance a name

Once created, click on your instance to access its settings and controls.

## Instance Overview

When you select an instance, you'll see several sections:

### Controls

- **Overview**: See the instance status and control buttons (Start, Pause, Stop)
- **Terminal**: Execute commands for this specific instance
- **Audit Log**: View a history of actions performed on this instance

### Settings

- **Bot Settings**: Configure the target server address, bot amount, join delays, protocol version, timeouts, and more
- **Account Settings**: Import and manage accounts for your bots
- **Proxy Settings**: Import and manage proxies
- **AI Settings**: Configure AI-related features
- **Instance Settings**: Configure instance-specific metadata

### Plugins

- **Plugins**: Enable/disable built-in plugins with a simple toggle switch
- **Plugin Settings**: Configure individual plugin settings
- **Scripts**: Manage instance-specific scripts

## Bot Settings

The Bot Settings panel is where you configure the core session parameters:

| Setting | Description | Default |

| Address | Target server address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:25565`) | `127.0.0.1:25565` |
| Amount | Number of bots to connect | `1` |
| Min Join Delay (ms) | Minimum delay between bot joins | `1000` |
| Max Join Delay (ms) | Maximum delay between bot joins | `3000` |
| Protocol Version | Minecraft version to use | Latest version |
| Read Timeout | Connection read timeout in seconds | `30` |
| Write Timeout | Connection write timeout in seconds | `0` |
| Connect Timeout | Connection timeout in seconds | `30` |
| Resolve SRV | Whether to resolve SRV records | Enabled |
| Concurrent Connects | Number of simultaneous connections | `1` |
| Restore on Reboot | Restore instance state after server restart | Enabled |

## Starting a Session

Once you've configured your instance:

1. Navigate to the **Overview** page of your instance
2. Click the **Start** button to begin the session
3. Monitor progress in the **Terminal** tab
4. Use **Pause** to temporarily halt the session
5. Use **Stop** to completely stop all bots

## Importing Proxies

To use proxies with your bots:

1. Select your instance and go to **Proxy Settings**
2. Use the import options to add proxies
3. Configure proxy settings like "Bots per proxy" (`-1` means unlimited)

To learn what format the proxies should be in, read the [Proxies Page](/docs/usage/proxies).

## Importing Accounts

To use specific accounts instead of auto-generated offline accounts:

1. Select your instance and go to **Account Settings**
2. Use the import options to add accounts
3. Configure account settings like "Name format" for offline accounts

To learn what format the accounts should be in, read the [Accounts Page](/docs/usage/accounts).

## Managing Plugins

SoulFire comes with many built-in plugins that can be enabled or disabled:

1. Select your instance and go to **Plugins**
2. Toggle plugins on/off using the switch next to each plugin
3. Click on a plugin name to configure its specific settings

Popular plugins include:
- **Auto Reconnect**: Automatically reconnects bots when disconnected
- **Auto Respawn**: Automatically respawns bots after death
- **Anti AFK**: Prevents bots from being kicked for inactivity
- **Chat Logger**: Logs chat messages to the terminal

## Commands

The Terminal tab provides a command input where you can interact with SoulFire.
Unlike Minecraft, commands do not start with `/`.
So instead of typing `/help`, you just type `help`.

Commands can be scoped to specific bots or instances:
- `bot Bot_1 say hello` - Run command for a specific bot
- `instance myinstance say hello` - Run command for all bots in an instance

For a full list of commands, see the [Commands Page](/docs/usage/commands).

## Themes

You can switch between light and dark themes using the theme toggle button in the bottom left corner of the interface.

## Language

SoulFire supports multiple languages. You can change the interface language using the language selector button in the bottom left corner.
