## What is WebDAV?

WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) allows you to access your SoulFire files remotely through a network connection.
This guide will show you how to set up and use WebDAV on different operating systems.

This guide expects that you have SoulFire already installed and running on your machine.
If you haven't done that yet, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation)

## What can you do with WebDAV?

WebDAV is a protocol that allows you to access and manage files on a remote server as if they were on your local machine.
With SoulFire's WebDAV support, you can:

- Access your SoulFire files from any device
- Edit configuration files and scripts remotely
- Upload and download instance data and script code
- Manage your SoulFire installation without direct access to the server

## Windows

### Connecting to WebDAV on Windows

1. Open File Explorer
2. Right-click on "This PC" and select "Add a network location"
3. Click "Next" in the wizard
4. Select "Choose a custom network location" and click "Next"
5. Enter the WebDAV URL (e.g., `http://your-server-ip:port/webdav`) and click "Next"
6. Enter your username and password if prompted
7. Give the connection a name (e.g., "SoulFire WebDAV") and click "Next"
8. Click "Finish" to complete the setup

You can now access your SoulFire files through the network location in File Explorer.

### Troubleshooting on Windows

If you encounter issues connecting to WebDAV on Windows:

- Make sure the WebDAV service is enabled in your SoulFire configuration
- Check that your firewall allows connections to the WebDAV port
- Try using the full URL including the http:// prefix
- Windows may require Basic Authentication to be enabled on the server

## macOS

### Connecting to WebDAV on macOS

1. Open Finder
2. Click on "Go" in the menu bar and select "Connect to Server" (or press âŒ˜K)
3. Enter the WebDAV URL (e.g., `http://your-server-ip:port/webdav`) in the Server Address field
4. Click "Connect"
5. Enter your username and password if prompted
6. The WebDAV share will appear as a mounted drive in Finder

### Troubleshooting on macOS

If you encounter issues connecting to WebDAV on macOS:

- Verify the WebDAV URL is correct
- Check network connectivity to the server
- Ensure your username and password are correct
- Try using https:// instead of http:// if SSL is enabled

## Linux

### Connecting to WebDAV on Linux

There are several ways to connect to WebDAV on Linux, depending on your distribution and desktop environment.

#### Using GNOME Files (Nautilus)

1. Open Files (Nautilus)
2. Click on "Other Locations" in the sidebar
3. In the "Connect to Server" field at the bottom, enter the WebDAV URL (e.g., `dav://your-server-ip:port/webdav`)
4. Click "Connect"
5. Enter your username and password if prompted

#### Using KDE Dolphin

1. Open Dolphin file manager
2. In the address bar, enter the WebDAV URL (e.g., `webdav://your-server-ip:port/webdav`)
3. Enter your username and password if prompted

#### Using davfs2 (Command Line)

1. Install davfs2:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install davfs2   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo yum install davfs2       # CentOS/RHEL
   ```

2. Create a mount point:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/webdav
   ```

3. Mount the WebDAV share:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t davfs http://your-server-ip:port/webdav /mnt/webdav
   ```

4. Enter your username and password when prompted

### Troubleshooting on Linux

If you encounter issues connecting to WebDAV on Linux:

- Check that the required packages are installed
- Verify that the WebDAV URL is correctly formatted
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to mount the filesystem
- Check system logs for more detailed error messages

## Security Considerations

When using WebDAV, keep the following security considerations in mind:

- Use HTTPS instead of HTTP when possible to encrypt your connection
- Do not share your WebDAV URL or credentials with unauthorized users
- Regularly update your SoulFire installation to patch security vulnerabilities
