## Who needs a Dedicated Server?

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Dedicated servers are for power-users, and are not recommended for beginners.
  If you're not sure if you need a dedicated server, you probably don't.
</Callout>

SoulFire is a Client/server application. The client is a user interface that a user interacts with,
and the server is the backend that processes the user's requests.
The server is responsible for managing the data, logic, and rules of the application.
The server is also responsible for managing the communication between the Bots and the Server.

## Why Dedicated Mode?

Dedicated mode brings a few advantages over GUI and CLI mode. For one, the application is long-running.
That means even if you close the GUI or CLI, the server will still be running in the background.
This is useful for running the server on a remote machine, or for running the server in the background on your local machine.

Both GUI and CLI come with an "integrated" server,
which means the server is started and stopped when the GUI or CLI is started and stopped.
This is useful for beginners, but can be limiting for power users.

An advantage of dedicated mode is also that multiple GUIs and CLIs can connect to the same server
as well as multiple servers can be run on the same machine on different ports. (Very useful for SF hosts)

While a CLI is similar to a dedicated server, it lacks the ability for other clients to connect
and also a CLI can only use settings for attacks that were specified when the CLI was started up.

## How to start the server in dedicated mode

Make sure your machine is using Java 21.
Next you can download the latest dedicated server `.jar` binary from the [download page](/)
and run it with the following command:

```bash
java -Xmx$RAM -XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational -XX:+AlwaysActAsServerClassMachine -XX:+UseNUMA -XX:+UseFastUnorderedTimeStamps -XX:+UseVectorCmov -XX:+UseCriticalJavaThreadPriority -Dsf.flags.v1=true -jar SoulFireDedicated.jar
```

Make sure to replace `$RAM` with the amount of ram you want to allocate to the server.
If you omit the entire `-Xmx$RAM` part, the server will use 25% of your total ram.
If your machine has 128GB of RAM and you want SF to use 120GB, you can use `-Xmx120G`.

## What options are available?

A dedicated server runs a server on a specified port and IP.
You can control the server using the following options:

| Property       | Description                     | Default   |
|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| `sf.grpc.host` | The ip the server will run on   | `0.0.0.0` |
| `sf.grpc.port` | The port the server will run on | `38765`   |

You can specify these options by passing them as system properties to the JVM.
For example, run the server via:

```bash
java -Dsf.grpc.port=12345 -Xmx$RAM -XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational -XX:+AlwaysActAsServerClassMachine -XX:+UseNUMA -XX:+UseFastUnorderedTimeStamps -XX:+UseVectorCmov -XX:+UseCriticalJavaThreadPriority -Dsf.flags.v1=true -jar SoulFireDedicated.jar
```

## Terminal flags

Additionally, you can explicitly enable/disable
having an interactive CLI in the terminal
where you can run SoulFire commands by setting `-Dterminal.jline=false` or `-Dterminal.jline=true`.
JLine is the library that allows for interactive CLI in the terminal,
it's the same library Minecraft, Velocity and other applications use.
You can also turn terminal colors explicitly on and off using `-Dterminal.ansi=false` or `-Dterminal.ansi=true`.

## Firewall

Ensure that all clients can reach the server by opening the port on your firewall.
This is not a guide for opening ports in your router, it's the same process as opening a port for a Minecraft server, just for a different port.

## How to generate an access token?

To connect to the server, you need an access token.
When you run a dedicated server, you get an interactive shell, just like with Minecraft servers.
You can use the `generate-token api` command to generate an access token.
Keep this token secure and only share it with people you trust and want to connect to your server.
It allows anyone with access to it to connect to your server via the GUI or CLI and start attacks.

## Docker images

Are you a Docker user?
We have a Docker image available for the dedicated server.
You can find it on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alexprogrammerde/soulfire).
You can find examples of how to use those Docker images in the [Docker section](/docs/guides/docker) of the documentation.

## What now?

You've successfully set up a dedicated server. Now go to the GUI or CLI and connect to it and try out some attacks!
Dedicated servers use the same underlying code as integrated servers, so the experience should be the same.
Servers do most of the heavy work, they run the attacks, check proxies, authenticate accounts, and more.
