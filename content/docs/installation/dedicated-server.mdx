## Automated Setup

This guide walks you through deploying a SoulFire Dedicated Server on a remote Linux server.
Our interactive setup script handles Docker installation, SSL configuration, and deployment automatically.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Get a server

    You need a Linux server (VPS) with a public IP address.
    Debian is the recommended distribution, but any major Linux distro works (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.).

    How much RAM you need depends on how many bots you plan to run:

    | Bots       | RAM    | vCPU |
    |------------|--------|------|
    | 1–50       | 2 GB   | 1    |
    | 50–200     | 4 GB   | 2    |
    | 200–500    | 8 GB   | 2    |
    | 500–1000   | 16 GB  | 4    |
    | 1000+      | 32 GB+ | 4+   |

      Get **20€ in free credits** on [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=HWdu4W4iHCgA) — this also supports SoulFire development!
    </Callout>

    When creating your server, choose the **Debian** image.
    Take note of the server's **public IP address** — you'll need it in the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Connect via SSH

    SSH (Secure Shell) lets you run commands on your server remotely.
    Open a terminal on your local machine and connect:

    ```bash
    ssh root@your-server-ip
    ```

    Replace `your-server-ip` with the IP address from the previous step.
    You'll be prompted for the password you set when creating the server (or it was emailed to you).

    On **Windows**, use PowerShell or Windows Terminal — both have SSH built in.
    On **macOS/Linux**, your default terminal works out of the box.

    <Callout type="info">
      For better security, consider setting up [SSH key authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/key) instead of passwords.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Run the setup script

    Once connected to your server, run the following command:

    ```bash
    wget -qO /tmp/sf-setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFire/main/scripts/soulfire-dedicated-setup.sh && sudo bash /tmp/sf-setup.sh
    ```

    The interactive setup will guide you through:
    - **System updates** and **Docker installation** (if needed)
    - **SSL configuration** — choose between Cloudflared tunnel, Traefik with domain SSL, Traefik with IP SSL, or plain HTTP
    - **Deploying SoulFire** via Docker Compose to `/opt/soulfire/`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Generate an access token

    After installation, re-run the same command to open the management menu:

    ```bash
    wget -qO /tmp/sf-setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFire/main/scripts/soulfire-dedicated-setup.sh && sudo bash /tmp/sf-setup.sh
    ```

    Select **Attach to SoulFire console**, then run:

    ```bash
    generate-token api
    ```

    Copy the generated token — you'll need it to connect the GUI client.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Connect the GUI client

    Open SoulFire on your PC ([install it](/docs/installation) if you haven't) and enter:
    - **Server URL**: The HTTPS URL you configured (e.g. `https://your-domain.com` or `https://your-server-ip`)
    - **Access token**: The token from the previous step

    That's it! You're now connected to your dedicated SoulFire server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing your server

Re-run the setup script at any time to access the management menu:

```bash
wget -qO /tmp/sf-setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFire/main/scripts/soulfire-dedicated-setup.sh && sudo bash /tmp/sf-setup.sh
```

From the menu you can:
- **Attach** to the SoulFire console to run commands
- **View logs** of running containers
- **Update** SoulFire to the latest version
- **Reconfigure** SSL settings
- **Uninstall** SoulFire completely
