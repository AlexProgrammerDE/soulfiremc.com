# Import Accounts

SoulFire allows you to configure accounts to use for attacks.

## How does this look in practice?

When you start an attack, SoulFire will use the accounts you provide to log in to the server.

Here is an example of how accounts work:

<Mermaid chart="
graph LR
    subgraph Y[SoulFire]
        S[SoulFire server]
        B1[Bot_1: Offline]
        B2[Pistonmaster: Microsoft Java]
        B3[BotAccount: The Altening]
    end
    subgraph M[Minecraft Server]
    end
    S --> B1
    S --> B2
    S --> B3
    B1 --> M
    B2 --> M
    B3 --> M
" />

Your setup may use more accounts/only one type of account, but the concept is the same.

## Account types

SoulFire supports Microsoft Java, Microsoft Bedrock, The Altening and Offline accounts.

If no account is selected, SoulFire will generate offline accounts based on the configured name format.

Select the account type in the GUI or CLI and use one of these formats with one account per line:

### Microsoft Java Credentials

The account needs to have bought Minecraft Java Edition.

```text
email:password
email2:password2
email3:password3
```

### Microsoft Java Device Code

This is a special login type where SoulFire will generate a device code for you to log in with on a Microsoft login page.

### Microsoft Bedrock Credentials

This is the only way to attack Bedrock Edition servers.
On Bedrock there is no game ownership check, so any Microsoft account can play on any Bedrock Edition server.
You need to have Xbox Live enabled on the account and have a gamer tag.

```text
email:password
email2:password2
email3:password3
```

### Microsoft Bedrock Device Code

This is a special login type where SoulFire will generate a device code for you to log in with on a Microsoft login page.

### The Altening

Accounts from [The Altening](https://thealtening.com/).

```text
token@alt.com
token2@alt.com
token3@alt.com
```

### Offline

Offline accounts are generally case-sensitive and can be used to attack servers that have explicitly set online-mode to false in their server.properties file.
So both `username` and `UserName` are valid offline accounts and can play at the same time.
Minecraft generates a case-sensitive UUID for each username, so the server can differentiate between them.
Most auth plugins like AuthMe however will block offline accounts that are spelled the same but have different cases.

```text
Username
Username2
Username3
```

## Shuffling accounts

SoulFire supports shuffling accounts, but it's disabled by default.
When enabled, SoulFire will shuffle the accounts randomly before starting the attack.
If disabled, SoulFire will use the accounts in the order they are in the settings.

The shuffling feature is useful if you want to randomize the order of the accounts to make it harder for servers to detect which accounts are bots on subsequent attacks.
