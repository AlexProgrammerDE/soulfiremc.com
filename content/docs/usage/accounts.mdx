import { Mermaid } from '../../../src/components/mdx/mermaid';

## How does this look in practice?

When you start a session, SoulFire will use the accounts you provide to log in to the server.

Here is an example of how accounts work:

<Mermaid chart="
graph LR
    subgraph Y[SoulFire]
        S[SoulFire server]
        B1[Bot_1: Offline]
        B2[Pistonmaster: Microsoft Java]
        B3[BotAccount: Offline]
    end
    subgraph M[Minecraft Server]
    end
    S --> B1
    S --> B2
    S --> B3
    B1 --> M
    B2 --> M
    B3 --> M
" />

Your setup may use more accounts/only one type of account, but the concept is the same.

## Looking for Minecraft accounts?

If you need Minecraft accounts for bot testing, check out our [Get Accounts](/get-accounts) page for a list of recommended providers.

### Ravealts Integration

SoulFire has a built-in integration with [Ravealts](https://ravealts.com) that lets you purchase and import accounts directly from within the client.
Open the Ravealts dialog in the account settings, enter your API key from the [Ravealts dashboard](https://dash.ravealts.com), and browse available stock.
After purchasing, accounts are automatically imported into your session in the correct format — no manual copy-pasting required.

## Account types

SoulFire supports Microsoft Java, Microsoft Bedrock, and Offline accounts.
It also supports importing accounts via refresh tokens, browser cookies, and raw access tokens.

If no account is selected, SoulFire will generate offline accounts based on the configured name format.

Select the account type in the GUI or CLI and use one of these formats with one account per line:

### Microsoft Java Credentials

The account needs to have bought Minecraft Java Edition.

```text
email:password
email2:password2
email3:password3
```

### Microsoft Java Device Code

This is a special login type where SoulFire will generate a device code for you to log in with on a Microsoft login page.

### Microsoft Bedrock Credentials

This is the only way to connect to Bedrock Edition servers.
On Bedrock there is no game ownership check, so any Microsoft account can play on any Bedrock Edition server.
You need to have Xbox Live enabled on the account and have a gamer tag.

```text
email:password
email2:password2
email3:password3
```

### Microsoft Bedrock Device Code

This is a special login type where SoulFire will generate a device code for you to log in with on a Microsoft login page.

### Microsoft Java Refresh Token

Import accounts using Microsoft refresh tokens. This is commonly used with NFA accounts purchased from account providers.
The refresh token allows SoulFire to obtain new access tokens automatically, so these accounts stay logged in long-term.

```text
refresh_token_here
refresh_token_here2
refresh_token_here3
```

### Microsoft Java Cookies

Import accounts using browser cookies from `login.live.com`. SoulFire accepts three cookie formats:

- **Netscape cookie jar** (tab-separated, exported from browsers or curl)
- **Cookie Editor JSON** (array of objects with domain/name/value, from the Cookie Editor browser extension)
- **Raw cookie header** (semicolon-separated name=value pairs)

SoulFire will exchange the cookies for a full authentication chain, so the account can be refreshed automatically.

### Microsoft Java Access Token

Import accounts using a raw Minecraft access token (JWT). This is useful for short-lived accounts where you only have the token itself.

```text
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

Note that access token accounts cannot be refreshed. Once the token expires, you will need to import a new one.

### Offline

Offline accounts are generally case-sensitive and can be used to connect to servers that have explicitly set online-mode to false in their server.properties file.
So both `username` and `UserName` are valid offline accounts and can play at the same time.
Minecraft generates a case-sensitive UUID for each username, so the server can differentiate between them.
Most auth plugins like AuthMe however will block offline accounts that are spelled the same but have different cases.

```text
Username
Username2
Username3
```

## Account Settings

When you navigate to the Account Settings page in SoulFire, you'll find several configuration options:

### Name format

The name format setting (default: `Bot_%d`) determines how offline accounts are named when generated automatically.
The `%d` placeholder is replaced with a number for each bot.
For example, with the default format, bots will be named `Bot_1`, `Bot_2`, `Bot_3`, etc.

### Shuffle accounts

SoulFire supports shuffling accounts, but it's disabled by default.
When enabled, SoulFire will shuffle the accounts randomly before starting the session.
If disabled, SoulFire will use the accounts in the order they are in the settings.

The shuffling feature is useful if you want to randomize the order of the accounts to make it harder for servers to detect which accounts are bots on subsequent sessions.

### Use proxies for account auth

When enabled, SoulFire will use your configured proxies when authenticating Microsoft accounts.
This is useful if you want to hide your IP address during the authentication process or if your IP is rate-limited by Microsoft.

### Account import concurrency

This setting (default: `3`) controls how many accounts can be imported simultaneously.
Higher values will import accounts faster but may cause rate limiting issues with Microsoft authentication servers.
