## SoulFire 2.0: Built on Fabric

<Callout type="info">
  SoulFire 2.0 was a complete rewrite that transformed SoulFire into a special **Fabric mod** running the official Minecraft client code.
  **SoulFire plugins are Fabric mods** and are loaded using the standard Fabric mod loader.
</Callout>

This architectural change brings massive benefits:

### Why Fabric?

- **Perfect vanilla parity**: SoulFire bots use the exact same code as the official Minecraft client, so they behave identically to real players on the server side
- **Accurate physics and movement**: Bot movement, action prediction, and collision detection are 100% accurate since they use Minecraft's actual physics code
- **Protocol parity**: Network communication matches the real client exactly, making bots effectively undetectable by anticheats
- **Faster version updates**: Supporting new Minecraft versions is significantly easier and faster since the Minecraft code is already present
- **Rapid feature development**: New features can be implemented quickly by building on top of existing Minecraft code
- **Third-party mod support**: Some existing Fabric mods can work with SoulFire out of the box

### Plugins = Fabric Mods

<Callout type="warn">
  **Important**: SoulFire plugins are now standard Fabric mods. They are loaded by the Fabric mod loader just like any other Fabric mod.
</Callout>

Since SoulFire plugins are Fabric mods:

- Plugins follow the standard Fabric mod structure (`fabric.mod.json`, entrypoints, etc.)
- Plugins are loaded from the `minecraft/mods` directory by the Fabric mod loader
- Plugins can use **Mixins** to modify both Minecraft and SoulFire code
- Plugins have full access to the Minecraft codebase and Fabric APIs
- Some existing Fabric mods may be compatible with SoulFire without modification

## Built-in plugins

SoulFire ships with several built-in plugins that are available by default.
These can be enabled or disabled per-instance in the Plugins section.

### How to generate this list

Run the command `print-docs plugins` in the console of the GUI, CLI or Dedicated server.

## Community plugins (Fabric mods)

Community plugins are Fabric mods that extend SoulFire's functionality.
Since SoulFire 2.0, plugins are standard Fabric mods that take full advantage of the Fabric ecosystem.

Any questions regarding how SoulFire works and how to write a plugin can be asked in the [Discord](/discord).

### How to write a plugin

Since SoulFire plugins are Fabric mods, you create them the same way you would create any Fabric mod:

1. Create a new Java or Kotlin project using the [Fabric mod template](https://fabricmc.net/develop/template/)
2. Add SoulFire as a dependency in your `build.gradle`
3. Create your `fabric.mod.json` with proper metadata and entrypoints
4. Use Mixins to hook into Minecraft or SoulFire code as needed
5. Build your mod as a standard Fabric mod `.jar` file

There is a [plugin template](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFirePluginExample) available on GitHub to help you get started.
Official Javadocs are hosted on [CodeMC CI](https://ci.codemc.io/job/AlexProgrammerDE/job/SoulFire/javadoc/index.html).

You can also look at the built-in plugins for inspiration on how to structure your plugin.

### How to install a plugin

To install a plugin, place the Fabric mod `.jar` file in the `minecraft/mods` directory:

- **Integrated server (GUI/CLI)**: Find the directory at `Help -> Data directory`, then navigate to `soulfire/minecraft/mods`
- **Dedicated server**: The `minecraft/mods` directory is located in the same directory as the server `.jar` file

SoulFire's Fabric mod loader will automatically load all mods from this directory at startup.

<Callout type="warn">
  Not all Fabric mods are compatible with SoulFire. Mods that require rendering, audio, or other client-only features will not work.
  Mods that modify game logic, networking, or add new functionality are more likely to be compatible.
