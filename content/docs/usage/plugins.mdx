# Plugins

Plugins are a way to extend the functionality of SoulFire.
SoulFire also comes with a few built-in plugins that can be enabled or disabled.

## Built-in plugins

We've prepared a list of built-in plugins that SoulFire ships by default with every SoulFire instance and are available by default.
Later on this page we'll show a list of external community plugins that extend the base SoulFire functionality.

### How to generate this list

Run the command `print-docs plugins` in the console of the GUI, CLI or Dedicated server.

## Community plugins

Community plugins are plugins that are not built-in but are made by the community.
Plugins can be written in Java or Kotlin and can be loaded at startup of the SoulFire server.
Plugins are able to use Mixins, which is the same system used in Minecraft mods to modify the game.
SoulFire does not use Minecraft code, so Minecraft mods are not compatible with SoulFire.
Plugins normally only modify the SoulFire application server, not the GUI/CLI interface directly.

Any questions regarding how SoulFire works and how to write a plugin can be asked in the [Discord](/discord).

### How to write a plugin

To write a plugin, you need to create a new Java or Kotlin project.
Right now there is no full guide on how to write a plugin, but you can look at the built-in plugins for inspiration.
There is also a [plugin template](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFirePluginExample) available on GitHub.
Official Javadocs are hosted on [CodeMC CI](https://ci.codemc.io/job/AlexProgrammerDE/job/SoulFire/javadoc/index.html).

### How to install a plugin

To install a plugin, you need to place the plugin `.jar` file in the `plugins` directory of the SoulFire server.
The SoulFire server will automatically load all `.jar` files in the `plugins` directory at startup.
The plugins directory is in different places depending on your setup and operating system.
If you use the client integrated server,
you'll find the `plugins` directory in the `Help -> Data directory` folder in the `soulfire/plugins` subdirectory.
If you use a dedicated server,
you'll find the `plugins` directory located in the same directory as the server `.jar` file.

### Plugin list

Feel free to share your plugins with the community here.
Open a pull request to add your plugin to the list.
Plugins should be open-source and hosted on GitHub.
If you want to share a paid plugin, please contact the developers.
