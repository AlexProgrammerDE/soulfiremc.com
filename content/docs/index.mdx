  **SoulFire 2.0** is built on **Fabric**, using official Minecraft client code. Bots now behave identically to real players.
</Callout>

## Why should I use SoulFire?

SoulFire strives to be the best bot tool for Minecraft servers.
It's simple enough for beginners, but gives advanced users full control.

SoulFire 2.0 was a complete rewrite that transformed SoulFire into a special Fabric mod running the official Minecraft client code.
Servers can't tell the bots apart from real players.

### Why Fabric-based?

SoulFire 2.0 uses the actual Minecraft client code through Fabric, which provides:

* **Perfect vanilla parity**: Bots use the exact same code as real Minecraft clients
* **100% accurate physics**: Movement, collisions, and action prediction match the real client exactly
* **Protocol parity**: Network communication is identical to real clients, making bots undetectable by most anticheats
* **Faster updates**: New Minecraft versions can be supported much more quickly
* **Fabric mod support**: SoulFire plugins are Fabric mods, and some third-party Fabric mods work out of the box
* **Multi-version support**: Through [ViaFabricPlus](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabricPlus), SoulFire supports Bedrock Edition, and every Minecraft Classic, Alpha, Beta, Release version, and April Fools snapshots, all while running on the latest Minecraft version

### Features

* Pathfinding system to measure chunk loading and entity processing
* Many [plugins](/docs/usage/plugins) to make your bots do useful things, such as kill aura, auto totem/armor/eat/jump and more
* Tools for advanced connections such as connecting to backend servers with proxy forwarding mode enabled (BungeeCord, Velocity, BungeeGuard)
