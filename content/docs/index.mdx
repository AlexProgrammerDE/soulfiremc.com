  **SoulFire 2.0** is built on **Fabric**, using official Minecraft client code. Bots are now virtually indistinguishable from real players.
</Callout>

## Why should I use SoulFire?

SoulFire strives on being the best bot tool for Minecraft servers.
It is designed to be straightforward to use, and to be as efficient as possible.
It is also designed to be as user-friendly as possible,
with a simple and easy-to-use interface that also allows you to do advanced things.

SoulFire 2.0 was a complete rewrite that transformed SoulFire into a special Fabric mod running the official Minecraft client code.
This makes bots virtually impossible to distinguish from real players on the server side.

### Why Fabric-based?

SoulFire 2.0 uses the actual Minecraft client code through Fabric, which provides:

* **Perfect vanilla parity**: Bots use the exact same code as real Minecraft clients
* **100% accurate physics**: Movement, collisions, and action prediction match the real client exactly
* **Protocol parity**: Network communication is identical to real clients, making bots undetectable by most anticheats
* **Faster updates**: New Minecraft versions can be supported much more quickly
* **Fabric mod support**: SoulFire plugins are Fabric mods, and some third-party Fabric mods work out of the box
* **Multi-version support**: Through [ViaFabricPlus](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabricPlus), SoulFire supports Bedrock Edition, and every Minecraft Classic, Alpha, Beta, Release version, and April Fools snapshots—all while running on the latest Minecraft version

### Features

* Pathfinding system to measure chunk loading and entity processing
* Many [plugins](/docs/usage/plugins) to make your bots do useful things, such as kill aura, auto totem/armor/eat/jump and more
* Tools for doing advanced attacks such as connecting to backend servers with proxy forwarding mode enabled (BungeeCord, Velocity, BungeeGuard)
