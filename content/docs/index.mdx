## Why should I use SoulFire?

SoulFire strives on being the best bot tool for Minecraft servers.
It is designed to be straightforward to use, and to be as efficient as possible.
It is also designed to be as user-friendly as possible,
with a simple and easy-to-use interface that also allows you to do advanced things.

The bot is also designed to be as hard to detect as possible,
