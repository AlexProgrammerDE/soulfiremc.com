# Installation on Windows (.exe)

Before installing, we recommend you to read the [main installation page](/docs/installation).

## Basic Installation

In this section, you can read how to set up SoulFire on your Windows PC.

<Steps>
  ### Download the software
  Download the latest Windows `.exe` installer from [the front page](/).

  ### Run the installer
  Go into the folder where you downloaded the installer and double-click it.

  ### Ignore warnings
  You may receive a warning from Windows Defender or your browser. You can ignore this warning and continue.
  For Windows Defender, click "More info" and then "Run anyway".

  This is a common issue with new software that doesn't have a lot of downloads yet.

  ### Follow the installer
  Follow the installer's instructions. You can leave most settings at their default values.

  ### That's it!
  You should now have SoulFire installed on your Windows PC. You can now open it from the Start menu, the Desktop icon
  or by searching for it.
