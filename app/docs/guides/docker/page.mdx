# Docker

SoulFire + Docker = ❤️
Official Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alexprogrammerde/soulfire).
Those contain the SoulFire Dedicated Server.
This guide assumes you know Docker and Docker compose well and are able to troubleshoot issues on your own.

## Pterodactyl/Pelican panel egg

You want to use Docker without the hassle of setting up the container yourself?
If you are a user of Pterodactyl/Pelican, you can use [the official egg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFire/main/soulfire_egg.json).

It is recommended to set up the [Cloudflared egg](https://github.com/Ym0T/pterodactyl-nginx-egg?tab=readme-ov-file#-cloudflared-tunnel-tutorial) to setup HTTPS to forward the SoulFire egg.

## How to install Docker?

Look at this [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).

## HTTPS setup

SoulFire uses HTTP, but if you run a public domain endpoint you're going to need HTTPS set up for dedicated servers.
You have two options, use Cloudflared as a HTTPS tunnel or set up a reverse proxy like Traefik with automatic HTTPS.

### Cloudflared tunnel (Recommended)

You get the token from the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard. Follow the [official guide]((https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) to learn how to get the Cloudflared tunnel token.

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  app:
    image: alexprogrammerde/soulfire
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:38765/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
    volumes:
      - app_data:/soulfire/data

  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared
    command: tunnel run
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN=mytokengoeshere

volumes:
  app_data:
    driver: local
```

### Traefik

Traefik is a powerful reverse proxy that allows serving SoulFire with HTTPS.
You will have to change the placeholders for the domain and email.

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  app:
    image: alexprogrammerde/soulfire
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:38765/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.soulfire.rule=Host(`your-domain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.soulfire.loadbalancer.server.port=38765"
      - "traefik.http.routers.soulfire.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.soulfire.tls.certresolver=myresolver"
    volumes:
      - app_data:/soulfire/data

  traefik:
    image: traefik
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=your@email.com"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
      - "letsencrypt:/letsencrypt"

volumes:
  app_data:
      driver: local
  letsencrypt:
    driver: local
```

## HTTP setup

Just setup SoulFire with no extra configuration or other services.

This will only serve SoulFire via HTTP. This means that traffic with SoulFire is unencrypted and insecure.
All tokens/emails are sent in cleartext and are hijackable with Man In The Middle attacks.
It is recommended to setup SoulFire using HTTPS.

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  app:
    image: alexprogrammerde/soulfire
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:38765/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
    ports:
      - '38765:38765'
    volumes:
      - app_data:/soulfire/data

volumes:
  app_data:
    driver: local
```
